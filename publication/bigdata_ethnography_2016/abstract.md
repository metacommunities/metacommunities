# Reflecting on the altered conditions of ethnographies of coding

Since starting in late 2007, the code repository Github (Github.com) has become tremendously popular amongst programmers.
The growth of Github is difficult to characterise because it brings together a wide variety of commercial, industry, government, educational and civil society actors, as well as a huge number of programmers. 
Coming almost a decade after ethnographies first paid serious attention to coding practices, property, publics and experiences of freedom in the free and open source software, Github's growth attests to some substantial transformations in the way coders, coding and code co-operate.
Because it is effectively a social media platform, Github displays many of the traits and tendencies of contemporary social media. 'Sharing,' 'liking,' 'watching' and re-circulation abound. 
Interesting features of Github include, but is not limited to, the generation of much data, indeed big data, about the practices of coding. 
If Github in late 2015 can claim to host 29 million code repositories and 6 million coders, then coding itself begins becomes a big data phenomena. 
The growth of Github,  the re-shaping of 'social' practices of coding, and the public availability of big data about coding affects the conditions under which ethnographic study might occur. 
Coders themselves render accounts of what they do through analysis of big data and its analytic tools. 
The chapter reports an attempts to bring an ethnographic sensibility to contemporary coders, coding and code as they encounter and themselves generate data.
