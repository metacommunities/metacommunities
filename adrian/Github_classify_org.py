# We are attempting to build a classifier for Github organisations. We want to see if organisations organise github (or not). Is the 'organisation' construct something that deeply shapes what happens on the platform? If so, in what ways?

# <markdowncell>

# ## Data sources
# 
# A. The table of ~500 organisations that Richard and Adrian coded by hand as types 0-4. This table is our training and test data. It took a long time to construct because we had to look at the repos and look at websites. We also tagged the organisation with domains like 'design', 'software' etc
# 
# This is the classification:
# 
# 0. junk or nothing -- equivalent to a spam organisation?
# 1. totally internal to github, almost fictional organisation that individual or group make for some benighted reason (e.g ours -- we have a research project) 
# 2. internal but substantial organisations that make something that goes out into the world -- e.g. a software project/product. Github is the main place they exist. Some of the repos should be forked by others 
# 3. external organisation who move into github as a way of revamping/expanding etc what they do. e.g. BBC. Github is not the main place they exist
# 4. Other â€“ impossible to classify
# 
# B. The table of ~ 80k organisations with as many features as we could find -- how many repos, do they fork, do they receive pull requests, do they have an external website, etc
