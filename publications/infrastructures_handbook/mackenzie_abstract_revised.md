# 'Dev-ops' and continuous building: when making infrastructures becomes operating infrastructures 

Adrian Mackenzie, Sociology, Lancaster, a.mackenzie@lancaster.ac.uk

This contribution will principally explore how we might think about infrastructures as cultural processes. It will do this by describing how certain infrastructures are increasingly made as and through software or code. It approaches software less in terms of digital media or control system, and more in terms of software as a permeable material threaded through many different media, communication, administrative and operational infrastructures. The conceptual genealogies I draw on include science and technology studies accounts of information and scientific data infrastructures [@Bowker_2005; @Edwards_2011], as well as anthropological accounts of software in terms of recursion and freedom [@Kelty_2008; @Coleman_2013].

The specific infrastructures I plan to discuss are the code repository platform Github.com with its millions of software repositories sprawling across many domains. The infrastructural dimensions of Github will be empirically specified in terms of the bodies of code that Gibhub's own software developers create and modify as they operate Github as a platform. Put more technically, the empirical focus is on the role of 'dev-ops' or developing-operating as a way of continuously re-fashioning infrastructures through continuous deployment. The increasing elision of any difference between making and operating is a striking feature of such infrastructures, and one that may affect the mode of existence of infrastructures more generally. The entry will explore how different infrastructural figures such as 'the platform,' 'the stack,' 'deployment' and 'build' intersect with various organisational, aesthetic, ethical and commercial regimes of engagement. A  combination of different materials ranging from images, texts, cloud or distributed computing services, various database and search engines, through to code repositories with their groups of contributors comprise the loose but interwoven infrastructures typical of such platforms.  They are hold together, I will suggest, in relational patterns that arise from recursive practice. The striking feature of platforms for software development is how much software development they attract in their own right. This recursive generation of patterned combinations, however, could be understood formally, but I will develop an account of the recursive practices that suggests how they occur when the line between making and operating infrastructures becomes unstable.
