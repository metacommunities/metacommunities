# Combinatorial infrastructures: the delirium of continuous building in code repositories

-- Combinatorial infrastructures: from compiling to continuous building

## questions from cfp

- Scholarship from science and technology studies, anthropology, urban geography, media studies and continental philosophy have challenged the dualist foundations upon which the conventional understanding of infrastructure rests. Shared among these scholars, is a view of infrastructures as complex, dynamic and fragile assemblages.
- How do you **methodologically** engage and analytically conceive of infrastructure. What conceptual genealogies do you draw on?
- Empirically how are you **specifying the infrastructural:** what is an infrastructure, for whom and in relation to what specific practices?   
- What constitutes the **specific infrastructural assemblage** with which you are concerned? What do infrastructures hold together (materials, institutions, practices, discourses, etc.) What is the stuff of a specific infrastructural arrangement?
- How are things **held together** (practices, techniques, relationships, standards, norms)? What are the modes of translation and/or conversion that a specific infrastructural form/dynamic implies?
- How do you engage the **emergent and unforeseeable** qualities of infrastructure, what we might call their experimental qualities?
    - How do infrastructures shape futures? What are the temporalities of the infrastructure? 
    - How do infrastructures shape new worlds or ontologies.  
    - How do infrastructures make space and create new scales of social interaction
    - What are the limits of infrastructure (where do they end, for whom, how and why)?
    - What are the materialities of infrastructure and what is their relation to ideals like discourses, visions, plans.
    - What is the relation between emergent infrastructures, new forms of politics and forms of social change, including resistance.

## ideas

- is assemblage thinking addressing what is happening today?
- who or what is infrastructure: lots of people or organisations call themselves infrastructure (the query here)
 the commit, diff, push and pull, clone and fork operations that define the writing of code might also be images of the actual assemblages that we encounter -- increasingly infrastructures are written; 
- snowden revelations about nsa suggest a kind of combinatorial generation of infrastructures, in which systems, machines, etc are stacked on top of each other
- data centres and their management as a critical infrastructure in multiple ways -- security, business, but access and participation -- but also in the way that they have generated new circuits of infrastructural work that tends to combinatorial contagions. 
- devops as a symptom of the change in the nature of infrastructres in that repair and maintenance are impossible to separate from experimentation and innovation (cf Google article on their experimental approach)
- github itself as an infra-infrastructure that seeks to cope with what people do -- can only use recursion to do this
- infrastructures as attempts to organise the field of participation and to organise social relations in global assemblages
- infrastructures are sense-making processes (with the double play on sense -- direction and perception)

## extract stuff

We know that infrastructures are written or inscribed all the way down, or almost all the way down. That is, contemporary infrastructures, especially those affected by information technology (I promise to use that term only once) are generated, configured and maintained by reading and writing things. Given that in many settings, the so-affected infrastructures are the actual norm, the process of reading and writing infrastructures matters greatly in the form of software. This is not to say that water, sanitation, energy, transport, communication, waste and environmental control infrastructures -- the so-called 'hard' infrastructures -- are actually 'soft', in the sense of software. One could say just the opposite and point out that the so-called 'soft' infrastructures of  police, government, justice, the military, education, health, or science -- are not thoroughly material.
