The assiduous efforts of government security agencies to access communications, messages and transactions epitomises contemporary combinatorial processes. NSA-O-Matic points to a more general infrastructural situation or process in which a relatively narrow range of communicative actions  elicit many different responses, on various scales across diverse cultural and social spheres. There is no single logic to the combinatorial exuberance at work in networked communication infrastructures, since it is the product of multiple determinations. We might look at the sheer abundance of 'apps,' relatively small pieces of software that connect mobile devices like phones into global-scale computing and communication infrastructures as another site of the combinatorial exuberance.
