## questions from cfp

- Scholarship from science and technology studies, anthropology, urban geography, media studies and continental philosophy have challenged the dualist foundations upon which the conventional understanding of infrastructure rests. Shared among these scholars, is a view of infrastructures as complex, dynamic and fragile assemblages.
- How do you **methodologically** engage and analytically conceive of infrastructure. What conceptual genealogies do you draw on?
- Empirically how are you **specifying the infrastructural:** what is an infrastructure, for whom and in relation to what specific practices?   
- What constitutes the **specific infrastructural assemblage** with which you are concerned? What do infrastructures hold together (materials, institutions, practices, discourses, etc.) What is the stuff of a specific infrastructural arrangement?
- How are things **held together** (practices, techniques, relationships, standards, norms)? What are the modes of translation and/or conversion that a specific infrastructural form/dynamic implies?
- How do you engage the **emergent and unforeseeable** qualities of infrastructure, what we might call their experimental qualities?
    - How do infrastructures shape futures? What are the temporalities of the infrastructure? 
    - How do infrastructures shape new worlds or ontologies.  
    - How do infrastructures make space and create new scales of social interaction
    - What are the limits of infrastructure (where do they end, for whom, how and why)?
    - What are the materialities of infrastructure and what is their relation to ideals like discourses, visions, plans.
    - What is the relation between emergent infrastructures, new forms of politics and forms of social change, including resistance.

## todo

- reference this repository -- recursive -- cite Gad and Jensen
- might need a few sentences about software as infrastructure and how that matters
- what's in a name? names as infrastructurally important because they hold together and allow experiment ..
- devops as the final result of nominalistic semiosis of infrastructures ... 

## ideas

- is assemblage thinking addressing what is happening today?
- who or what is infrastructure: lots of people or organisations call themselves infrastructure (the query here)
- github is like a small, high-tech island -- a Singapore or a Lagos of the internet -- tremendous amounts of sophisticated affluence surrounded by a morain of service, administrative, maintenance and individual projects (something like the night markets in Singapore as a trace of former panoply)
- infrastructures as superimposed global, like a global variable (Ong & Collier) -- become an important referent -- but actual practices that cannot simply refer to a static global variable. 
- the commit, diff, push and pull, clone and fork operations that define the writing of code might also be images of the actual assemblages that we encounter -- increasingly infrastructures are written; 
- snowden revelations about nsa suggest a kind of combinatorial generation of infrastructures, in which systems, machines, etc are stacked on top of each other
- data centres and their management as a critical infrastructure in multiple ways -- security, business, but access and participation -- but also in the way that they have generated new circuits of infrastructural work that tends to combinatorial contagions. 
- devops as a symptom of the change in the nature of infrastructres in that repair and maintenance are impossible to separate from experimentation and innovation (cf Google article on their experimental approach)
- github itself as an infra-infrastructure that seeks to cope with what people do -- can only use recursion to do this
- infrastructures as attempts to organise the field of participation and to organise social relations in global assemblages
- infrastructures are sense-making processes (with the double play on sense -- direction and perception)

## extract stuff

We know that infrastructures are written or inscribed all the way down, or almost all the way down. That is, contemporary infrastructures, especially those affected by information technology (I promise to use that term only once) are generated, configured and maintained by reading and writing things. Given that in many settings, the so-affected infrastructures are the actual norm, the process of reading and writing infrastructures matters greatly in the form of software. This is not to say that water, sanitation, energy, transport, communication, waste and environmental control infrastructures -- the so-called 'hard' infrastructures -- are actually 'soft', in the sense of software. One could say just the opposite and point out that the so-called 'soft' infrastructures of  police, government, justice, the military, education, health, or science -- are not thoroughly material. 


## abstract

The NSA-o-matic is a very small piece of code that generates **names** of potential US NSA (National Security Agency) information infrastructures. We know from the files released by Edward Snowden something of the existence of sprawling cyber-security infrastructures such as XKEY, TREASUREMAP, and so forth [TBA - some of the recent literature on this]. One of the problems in making sense of contemporary communication infrastructures is the sheer variety of channels, modalities, platforms, scales of operation and levels of infrastructural interdependency. The Snowden revelations, in all their confusing variety, attest to a kind of combinatorial delirium in generating new ways of interacting with infrastructures. The NSA-O-Matic plays on this combinatorial process to generate the names of possible NSA infrastructures. The humour of the NSA-O-Matic derives partly from the disparity between the seemingly endless panoply of surveillance infrastructures with tendrils into every aspect of contemporary communications (wireless routers, skype conversations, network hubs, mobile phone conversations, social media, email messages, etc.) and the democratically-mandated authority of government figures such as General Keith Alexander or Senator Dianne Feinstein, and the perfunctory and weak oversight associated with the public assurance. The hard infrastructure of communication and the soft infrastructure of justice or government seem radically misaligned. 

This situation is not unique to the NSA or government intelligence agencies of a similar ilk. Indeed, their assiduous and passionate commitment to infrastructural access is well and truly part of the contemporary combinatorial processes I would like to focus on here. NSA-O-Matic points to a more general situation or to a problem that elicits many different responses, on various scales across diverse cultural and social spheres. There is no single logic to the combinatorial exuberance at work in networked communication infrastructures, since it is the product of multiple determinations. We might look at the sheer abundance of 'apps,' relatively small pieces of software that connect mobile devices like phones into global-scale computing and communication infrastructures as another site of the combinatorial exuberance.

What I like about the spoof infrastructures that NSA-O-Matic generates is that it relies almost completely on  names. While strenuous and important efforts are being made to map the connections between the NSA's 'programs' and the communications and computing infrastructures that many of us use daily, it might be worth staying close to the practices that generate the combinations that NSA-O-Matic amusingly generates. It is quite difficult for social researchers to study TREASUREMAP or XKEY directly, but there are infrastructural interstices where the combinatorial play can be mapped a little more: code repositories. This contribution will principally explore how we might think about infrastructures as cultural processes using coding repositories. It will do this by describing how certain infrastructures are increasingly made as and through software or code. It approaches software less in terms of digital media or control system, and more in terms of software as a permeable material threaded through many different media, communication, administrative and operational infrastructures. The conceptual genealogies I draw on include science and technology studies accounts of information and scientific data infrastructures [@Bowker_2005; @Edwards_2011], as well as anthropological accounts of software in terms of recursion and freedom [@Kelty_2008; @Coleman_2013] (although it lies quite a long way from debates about open vs closed source code, the debate that monopolised attention to software during much of the last decade). Naming practices offer a viable way of working with the bodies of code, protocols, standards, devices, diagrams, statements and operations that underpin the combinatorial delirium I want to describe here. Methodologically speaking, focusing on names might seem a bit counter-revolutionary, since attention to practice, materiality, devices, things, non-human actors and generally extra-discursive elements has been one of the hallmarks of the attention.


The specific infrastructures I plan to discuss is the code repository platform Github.com with its millions of software repositories sprawling across many domains. A code repository stores the source code, associated documents, files, configuration information and a verity of other materials associated with software.  Github is rather like NSA-O-Matic writ large, since the millions of code repositories it hosts not only address almost any kind of digital hardware and software one can imagine, but seem to be animated by the same combinatorial delirium that NSA-O-Matic, itself a Github-hosted project, plays with. It is difficult to characterise the heterogeneity of things, devices, conventions, platforms and organisations present on Github itself, and indeed, this difficulty is one of the motivations to describe what happens there in terms of names. The one thing, it seems, that Github in aggregate cannot dispense with is the need to name things. [TBA this point is not quite right -- needs to convey the power of names more ... ]  In some ways,  Github looks like a typical contemporary social media platform since it has much of the social media appurtenances of participation (followers, groups, watchers, stars, etc.; see [@Kelty_TBA] on participation). In many different ways, Github epitomises contemporary attempts to 'socialise' digital devices, infrastructures and networks by (a) rendering them all as code-like entities; (b) rendering code as a social practice of participation.  However, the trappings of social media and its imperatives -- 'be social, share code' -- with their focus on networks of relations between people largely occlude the tremendous combinatorial processes occurring on Github and git-like platforms more generally. The fluxes of imitation of names and their recombinant energy constantly overflow and elude the constraints of the imperative to 'be social.' This is the first and somewhat ironic feature of approaching infrastructures in terms of names and naming. It turns out, or least this is what I seek to argue, that names and naming offer a kind of access to the materiality of contemporary infrastructures that deeper more substantial understandings of social in terms of practice and explicit concepts of agency and materiality may not (and this is precisely because a certain version of 'the social' has become an object of such concerted technical interest). 

## An infrastructural semiosis?

What access to infrastructure might be afforded by names? If we viewed, as we cannot, the 13 million or so unique code repositories hosted on Github, we would first encounter a rather complex baffling array of repository names. Repository names on Github can be any combination of letters or characters. These range from the almost casually random, yet still recognisable repositories named `asdf` (the first four characters on the home-row of an English keyboard) or `1234`, both of which number in their thousands through to highly recognisable names such as `linux` or `apache.` Both of the latter projects are well-known as key infrastructural elements of contemporary digital networks, the `linux` kernel in particular representing one of the main ways in which coding work has become more visible as a cultural and social practice [@Coleman_2012; @Kelty_2008; @Mackenzie_2006], and practically permeates the information infrastructural *stack*. The stack comprises a diverse range of materials that could include storage systems (disk drives), servers, network resources, hardware specificities, data models and database architectures, business and transactional logics, software frameworks that connect elements of systems and architectures together, user interfaces including how screen elements such as graphics, interactive devices and text operate together. The first four layers of this stack, for instance, would be dominated by `linux` kernel versions, since the Android operating system, which has the largest installed base, is a version of `linux`. Or, if we turned from handheld devices to supercomputers, 97% reportedly use `linux.` This is clearly a repository of no little significance.  While `apache` is perhaps less well-known, it has for over a decade now has served the largest share of websites (around 40% or 340 million sites in January 2015 [@Netcraft_2015]). Between the two extremes of the random keypress repositories and the installed bulk of `linux` or `apache` stand a very diverse and densely populated range of repositories whose dynamics could, if read right, tell us quite a lot about what how infrastructures take shape, multiply, combine, and decay. Processes of repair, re-invention, appropriation, capitalisation and speculation might start to take on a more fine-grained consistency here, but most importantly, we can already begin to see that infrastructures, insofar as they  are articulated in code, rely on a nominalistic semiosis. The gamut of millions of names of Github repositories, enough to populate a small country, is somewhat heterogeneous, pluralistic and full of transient multiplicities, but axes of organisation that assemble infrastructural elements into something like the 'full stack' associated with the digital networks can be discerned there. The distance between repositories called 'asdf' and 'linux' is hard to imagine because the former typically represent ephemeral contacts between people and infrastructures (for instance, many such repositories just show the traces of people trying out or learning to use Github) and the latter encompass whole network architectonics. Movement along the axis between ephemeral and durable (the `linux` repository has been hosted on Github since 2007[^1]) is relatively easy on Github itself since that platform, with its infrastructures for storage, searching, tracking and graphing of coding work, arrays all repositories on the same surface. In this respect, it renders all infrastructures superficial, and this superficiality is perhaps a somewhat novel experience.

[^1]: An analysis of the pre-2007 trajectory of `linux` as a body of code can be found in [@Mackenzie_2006, Chapter 4].

## The namespace -- a way of thinking about infrastructural couplings

Infrastructures like Github induce the nominalistic semiosis of stacked infrastructures more generally by allocating all things a position in a _namespace_. Nearly all software code heavily relies on naming practices. Whether viewed as a series of statements, commands or functions, naming and the forms of address associated with names weave inextricably through software. It is only more recently, however, that the relations and connections between disparate bodies of code of many different ilk have all started to take place in a common namespace. Naming practices themselves, moreover, display specificities that might help us analyse the differences and associations between people and infrastructures are re-iteratively re-drawn. For instance, on Github, the names of code repositories when fully specified have a number of components. Take the 70,000 or so repositories whose names include the term `JQuery.' `JQuery' is a software library that web developers use to design the kinds of interactive webpages full of buttons, animations, dynamics menus, etc. that we associate with say browsing the web or buying a train ticket online. The details of `JQuery` need not concern us here, but it is interesting that its popularity amongst web developers -- more than 50% of all websites were making use of it in 2012 [@W3Techs_2012] -- arises from the way that it allows webpages written in HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML) to be manipulated as a set of named elements. In other words, `JQuery` subjects the display screen as a set of named elements subject to operations. Statements written using `JQuery` operate to generate text and graphics that people read, scroll, click, and select. This relatively banal example of how a page becomes a field of named entities pertains much more generally.  If for instance we turn to the much more obviously infrastructural operations of something like Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute 2 (AWS EC2), something similar appears. The approximately 21,000  Github repositories relating to AWS EC2 display a great range of concerns, but nearly all offer ways of naming and addressing instances of `linux` services running in Amazon's data centres. These may be implemented in different programming languages -- Haskell, Ruby, Python, Java or Javascript -- and many different naming conventions permeate these different languages, but all of them rely subject the operation of elements in AWS EC2 to invocations.

I say there are 70,000 `JQuery` repositories or 20,000 AWS EC2 repositories. How are they related or distinct from each other. The fully qualified naming of things is an important pre-occupation of contemporary infrastructures. In the case of Github, every repository has a unique name, even if it is a clone of another repository. The basic form of this qualification combines a person or organisation and a thing, device, system, convention, protocol or infrastructure. The base name for all the copies of `JQuery` is `jquery/JQuery`. The left hand part of the name is a person or an organisation, in this case, the JQuery organisation or the [jQuery Foundation](https://jquery.org/), while the right hand part points to the code itself, code that will inevitably contain many further named elements that need not concern us here. The name of a repository always combines a person or organisation (`BBC`, `Google`, `Twitter`, `WhiteHouse`, `torvalds`, etc.) and a thing (`jQuery`, `bootstrap`. `linux`, `dotfile`, etc.). Many repositories differ from each other _only_ in name. That is, some thousands of the `jQuery` repositories will be strictly speaking _clones_ of the primary `jQuery/jQuery` (or the jQuery Foundation's primary `jQuery` repository) differentiated only by the person or organisation with whom they are  concatenated. Thus the fully qualified name of repository inextricably points in more than one direction. It does not index or symbolise either people or things but always a concatenation of organisation/person/device/thing.

Such concatenations are familiar in science and technology studies accounts of technologies and scientific knowledges (since they, for instance, lie at the base of actor-network theory accounts of translation and displacement [@Callon_1985] or human-machine configurations [@Suchman_2006]). They do, however, intensify in contemporary infrastructures because the very operation of the thing/device/system/framework/protocol/tool/technique and the position assigned to the subjects who make statements about the infrastructure come much closer together and indeed mingle in code. Strictly speaking, the subject position marked by the left hand end of a Github repository name overflows the  `/` that separates it from the body of code that addresses devices or systems on the right hand side. The situation here is captured well in Michel Foucault's account of the constituting and generating operations of statements in _The Archaeology of Knowledge_:

> In each case the position of the subject is linked to the existence of an operation that is both determined and present; in each case, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation (he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it; he who posits the existence of a finite series is also, and at the same time, he who states it) ; and in each case, the subject links, by means of this operation and the statement in which it is embodied , his future statements and operations (as an enunciating subject, he accepts this statement as his own law) [@Foucault_1972, 94-95].

Repositories comprise sequences of statements instituting the operating limits, the patterns of inscription and transcription, the regularities and usages that comprise infrastructures in practice. These statements take effect, or implement something only through the coincidence that Foucault describes here. The subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation, Foucault claims (and he is describing here what he terms a 'discursive formation').  This is reminiscent of more recent accounts of performativity and things, but the embodiment of the operation in the statement -- and effectively I am suggesting that the repository name refers to such statements -- also mobilises future statements and operations. How so, in terms of what happens on  Github repositories?

One way to discriminate this linking of subjects and operations appears in all the repository names associated with `jQuery` that are not simply clones of the `jquery/jquery` repository. That is, the vast majority of the repository names in which `jquery` appears also contain some other name. Composite names comprise much of the proliferating bulk on  Github at various levels. For instance, names such as:

>jquery-postcode-anywhere
>jquery-bingsearch
>select2-json-php-mysql-bootstrap-jquery
>jquery-django-formset
>twitter-jquery-plugin

display a range of infrastructural compositions occurring around `jquery`, ranging from postal address systems (postcodes) through web search engines, layers in the internet stack (web servers, databases, web frameworks) and social media platforms. This sample of composite names is by no means representative since much of the compositional semiosis around `jquery` pivots on individual elements of webpage user interfaces such as forms, menus, scrollbars and so on. Whether they stick closely to the graphic display of text and image or range more widely into the linkages between infrastructural layers, the combinatory composition that begins to appear in these repository names operates much more widely in mobilising infrastructures. Very easily, I suggest, we could find imitative and combinatory fluxes running across the millions of repositories on Github just at this banal level of names and naming. Other imitative and combinatory fluxes run much more deeply through the elements of coding, configuring, maintaining and repair work going on in the code.

## Devops and the lability of infrastructures

[HERE] These deeper fluxes are not easy to see in the nominalistic semiosis described above. They might be discerned however


The infrastructural dimensions of Github will be empirically specified in terms of the bodies of code that Gibhub's own software developers create and modify as they operate Github as a platform. Put more technically, the empirical focus is on the role of 'dev-ops' or developing-operating as a way of continuously re-fashioning infrastructures through continuous deployment. The increasing elision of any difference between making and operating is a striking feature of such infrastructures, and one that may affect the mode of existence of infrastructures more generally. The entry will explore how different infrastructural figures such as 'the platform,' 'the stack,' 'deployment' and 'build' intersect with various organisational, aesthetic, ethical and commercial regimes of engagement. A  combination of different materials ranging from images, texts, cloud or distributed computing services, various database and search engines, through to code repositories with their groups of contributors comprise the loose but interwoven infrastructures typical of such platforms.  They are hold together, I will suggest, in relational patterns that arise from recursive practice. The striking feature of platforms for software development is how much software development they attract in their own right. This recursive generation of patterned combinations, however, could be understood formally, but I will develop an account of the recursive practices that suggests how they occur when the line between making and operating infrastructures becomes unstable.
