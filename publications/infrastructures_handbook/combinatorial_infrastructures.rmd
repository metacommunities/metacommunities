The NSA-o-matic is a toy piece of code that generates *names* of fictional US NSA (National Security Agency) knowledge infrastructures by colligating names of devices, systems, protocols and standards and naming them with proper names compounded from actually existing infrastructures. We know from the files released by Edward Snowden something of the existence of sprawling cyber-security infrastructures such as XKEY, TREASUREMAP, SKYNET and so forth [@CJFE_2015]. The Snowden revelations, in all their confusing variety, attest to a kind of combinatorial delirium in generating new ways of interacting with infrastructures. The humour of NSA-O-Matic derives partly from the disparity between the existence of a seemingly technically far-fetched juxtapositions -- USB hardware that deanonymizes communications satellites? -- and our still somewhat inchoate and stunned knowledge of infrastructures growing tendrils into every aspect of contemporary communications (wireless routers, skype conversations, network hubs, mobile phone conversations, social media, email messages, etc.). The public assurances extracted from U.S. government figures such as General Keith Alexander or Senator Dianne Feinstein only emphasise the threadbare democratic mandate for the existence of such systems.  The hard infrastructure of communication and the soft infrastructure of justice or government seem radically misaligned. 

The combinatorial delirium is not unique to the NSA or government intelligence agencies of a similar ilk. One of the problems in knowing infrastructures is the sheer variety of channels, devices, standards, modalities, platforms, scales of operation and levels of interdependency. The assiduous commitment of government security agencies to infrastructural access epitomises contemporary combinatorial processes. NSA-O-Matic points to a more general situation or to a process  that elicits many different responses, on various scales across diverse cultural and social spheres. There is no single logic to the combinatorial exuberance at work in networked communication infrastructures, since it is the product of multiple determinations. We might look at the sheer abundance of 'apps,' relatively small pieces of software that connect mobile devices like phones into global-scale computing and communication infrastructures as another site of the combinatorial exuberance.

NSA-O-Matic spoofs knowledge of putative knowledge infrastructures. It relies on names to evoke the opacity and depth of infrastructures. While  important efforts are being made to map the connections between NSA 'programs' named in the Snowden documents and specific communications and computing infrastructures that many of us use daily [@GuardianNews_2015], it might be worth staying close to the naming practices that generate the combinations that NSA-O-Matic displays.  We might apprehend something of the  unfurling,  unstable opacity of contemporary infrastructures by examining only the names of their constituent fragments, fragments whose provenance may attest to splintering [@Graham_2001] but also to the naturalisation of infrastructures [@Bowker_1999, 326].  If, like NSA-O-Matic, we apprehend infrastructures by name only, how do infrastructures appear to us? Somewhat inverse to tendencies to see depth and scale as the underpinning power dynamic in infrastructures,  it might be worth engaging with what could be called _nominalistic semiosis_ or *infrastructures in name* only.[^c.1] All infrastructures, no matter how subterranean, act semiotically. The rusted bolts, the cracked concrete plinths, the stanchions, bars, girders, plugs, cables, stone, steel, glass, rubber, oil, plastic, electricity, gas and springs participate in semiosis.  They have designations that often appear as labels in diagrams, and they indexically function as re-agents of what they designate: rust suggests moisture, cloudy or black oil suggests wear, etc., to infrastructural interpretants.  While we might approach knowledge infrastructures in terms of the growth of forms such as 'platforms' [@Gillespie_2010] or increasingly programmed or protocol control [@Beniger_1986; @Galloway_2004], perhaps their consistency and variety owes much to a permeable network of names threaded through many different media, communication, administrative and operational practices. Naming practices offer a viable way of navigating the densely trafficked archipelagos of code, protocols, standards, devices, diagrams, statements and operations shaping many infrastructuring practices. Methodologically speaking, focusing on names might seem a bit counter-productive, since attention to practice, materiality, devices, things, non-human actors and generally extra-discursive elements has been one of the hallmarks of the attention. Naming, however, operationally links people and things, places and devices together in complicated associations. 

[^c.1]: In 'Pragmatism in Retrospect: a Last Formulation,' C.S. Peirce writes, 'by semiosis, I mean ... an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of _three_ subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs' [@Peirce_1955, 282].  He goes on to note that the interpretant, the entity affected by an encounter with a sign is not necessarily a person, although it is easier to think about semiosis in terms of people. 

## Mapping name spaces in code

Where can infrastructural semiosis be studied? In online code repositories,  naming constitutes a primary form of designation, manipulation and operation. All code inhabits name spaces.  The largest repository of code, the code repository platform (Github.com)[http://www.github.com] with around 20 million repositories  (in 2015) sprawling across many domains, epitomises the growth of name spaces in code. Code repositories store the source code, associated documents, files, configuration information and a variety of other materials associated with software.[^d.1]  Github is rather like NSA-O-Matic writ large, since the code repositories it hosts not only address almost any kind of digital hardware and software practice one can imagine, but seem to be animated in their growth since 2007 by the same combinatorial delirium that NSA-O-Matic, itself a Github-hosted project, plays with. It is difficult to characterise the heterogeneity of things, devices, conventions, platforms and organisations present amongst the  Github code repositories, and indeed, this difficulty is one of the motivations to describe what happens there in terms of names. Not all Github code repositories can be read as infrastructures. When is an infrastructure remains a critical question for code-based systems. But many of them, ranging from operating system such as `Linux` to code libraries for managing cloud-based deployments (`puppet`, `chef`, etc.) exhibit infrastructural becomings. Code and coding have been widely discussed as making contemporary infrastructure what it is. The conceptual genealogies I draw on include science and technology studies accounts of information and scientific data infrastructures [@Bowker_2005; @Edwards_2011], as well as anthropological accounts of software in terms of recursion and freedom [@Kelty_2008; @Coleman_2013] (although it lies quite a long way from debates about open vs closed source code, the debate that monopolised attention to software during much of the last decade) and connections between network infrastructure and contemporary urban experience [@Graham_2001; @Thrift_2014].

In some ways,  Github looks like a typical contemporary social media platform since it has much of the social media appurtenances of participation (followers, groups, watchers, stars, etc.; see [@John_2013] on participation) and invokes the ethico-economic injunction to 'share.' But what Github seeks to socialise is coding as a practice, a practice that takes place in many domains and across boundaries between devices, infrastructures, institutions and things. Github epitomises contemporary attempts to 'socialise' digital devices, infrastructures and networks by  rendering them all as code-like entities, but at the same time, it treats coding as a social practice of participation, somehow akin to photo-sharing or chatting with friends using a social media platform.  On the one hand, it is a social media platform on which infrastructures become the contents of social rituals and enactments. In this respect, Github might be seen as a meta-infrastructure. On the other hand, the trappings of social media and its imperatives -- 'be social, share code' -- with their focus on networks of relations between people largely occlude the tremendous combinatorial processes occurring on Github and `git`-like platforms more generally. The fluxes of imitation of names and their recombinant energy constantly overflow and elude the constraints of the imperative to 'be social.' Hence, Github is always already a somewhat 'splintered' meta-infrastructure. 

[^d.1]: The practices of working with code repositories on Github are quite complicated, and not the focus on discussion here. The advent of the `git` approach to the management of code has led to a very wide-ranging set of changes in the production of code, and Github has become the 'largest code repository on the planet' [@Git_2014] by riding along with these shifts. Software engineering researchers have taken a keen interest in these repositories precisely because they seem to offer access to how software is actually built [@Takhteyev_2010; @Thung_2013]. 

What access to infrastructure might be afforded by names? It turns out, or least this is what I seek to argue, that names and naming offer a kind of grounding in the relational adhesives of contemporary infrastructures. If we viewed, as we cannot, the 13 million or so unique code repositories hosted on Github in 2015, we would first encounter a rather complex baffling array of repository names. Repository names on Github can be any combination of letters or characters. These range from the almost casually random, yet still recognisable repositories named `asdf` (the first four characters on the home-row of an English keyboard) or `1234`, both of which number in their thousands through to highly recognisable names such as `linux` or `apache.` Both of the latter projects are well-known as key infrastructural elements of contemporary digital networks, the `linux` kernel in particular representing one of the main ways in which coding work has become more visible as a cultural and social practice [@Coleman_2012; @Kelty_2008; @Mackenzie_2006], and practically permeates the information infrastructural *stack*. The stack comprises a diverse range of materials that could include storage systems (disk drives), servers, network resources, hardware specificities, data models and database architectures, business and transactional logics, software frameworks that connect elements of systems and architectures together, user interfaces including how screen elements such as graphics, interactive devices and text operate together. The first four layers of this stack, for instance, would be dominated by `linux` kernel versions, since the Android operating system, which has the largest installed base, is a version of `linux`. Or, if we turned from handheld devices to supercomputers, 97% reportedly use `linux.` This is clearly a repository of no little significance.  While `apache` is perhaps less well-known, it has for over a decade now has served the largest share of websites (around 40% or 340 million sites in January 2015 [@Netcraft_2015]).

Between the two extremes of the random keypress repositories and the installed bulk of `linux` or `apache` stand a very diverse and densely populated range of repositories whose names could, if read serially and in parallel, tell us quite a lot about what how infrastructures take shape, multiply, combine, and decay in full-stack. Processes of repair, re-invention, appropriation, capitalisation and speculation might start to take on a more fine-grained consistency here, but most importantly, we can already begin to see that infrastructures, insofar as they  are articulated in code, rely on a _nominalistic semiosis_. The gamut of millions of names of Github repositories, enough to populate a small country, is somewhat heterogeneous, pluralistic and full of transient multiplicities, but axes of organisation that assemble infrastructural elements into something like the 'full stack' associated with the digital networks can be discerned there. The distance between repositories called 'asdf' and 'linux' is hard to imagine because the former typically represent ephemeral contacts between people and infrastructures (for instance, many such repositories are the traces of people trying out or learning to use Github) and the latter encompass whole network architectonics. Movement along the axis between ephemeral and durable (the `linux` repository has been hosted on Github since 2007[^1]) is relatively easy on Github itself since that platform, with its infrastructures for storage, searching, tracking and graphing of coding work, arrays all repositories on the same surface. In this respect, it renders all infrastructures superficial, and this superficiality is perhaps a somewhat novel experience.

[^e.1]: C.S. Peirce writes, 'by semiosis, I mean ... an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of _three_ subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs' [@Peirce_1955, 282].  He goes on to note that the interpretant, the entity affected by an encounter with a sign is not necessarily a person, but it is easier to think about semiosis in terms of people. 

[^1]: An analysis of the pre-2007 trajectory of `linux` as a body of code can be found in [@Mackenzie_2006, Chapter 4].

## The namespace -- a way of thinking about infrastructural couplings

Infrastructures like Github induce the nominalistic semiosis of stacked infrastructures more generally by allocating all things a position in a _namespace_. Nearly all software code heavily relies on naming practices. Whether viewed as a series of statements, commands or functions, naming and the forms of address associated with names weave inextricably through software. It is only more recently, however, that the relations and connections between disparate bodies of code of many different ilk have all started to take place in a common namespace. Naming practices themselves, moreover, display specificities that might help us analyse the differences and associations between people and infrastructures are re-iteratively re-drawn. For instance, on Github, the names of code repositories when fully specified have a number of components. Take the 70,000 or so repositories whose names include the term `JQuery`.`JQuery` is a software library that web developers use to design the kinds of interactive webpages full of buttons, animations, dynamics menus, etc. that we associate with say browsing the web or buying a train ticket online. The details of `JQuery` need not concern us here, but it is interesting that its popularity amongst web developers -- more than 50% of all websites were making use of it in 2012 [@W3Techs_2012] -- arises from the way that it allows webpages written in HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML) to be manipulated as a set of named elements. In other words, `JQuery` subjects the display screen as a set of named elements subject to operations. Statements written using `JQuery` operate to generate text and graphics that people read, scroll, click, and select. This relatively banal example of how a page becomes a field of named entities pertains much more generally.  If for instance we turn to the much more obviously infrastructural operations of something like Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute 2 (AWS EC2), something similar appears. The approximately 21,000  Github repositories relating to AWS EC2 display a great range of concerns, but nearly all offer ways of naming and addressing instances of `linux` services running in Amazon's data centres. These may be implemented in different programming languages -- Haskell, Ruby, Python, Java or Javascript -- and many different naming conventions permeate these different languages, but all of them rely subject the operation of elements in AWS EC2 to invocations.

There are 70,000 `JQuery` repositories or 20,000 AWS EC2 repositories. How are they related or distinct from each other? The fully qualified naming of things is an important pre-occupation in contemporary infrastructural work. In the case of Github, every repository has a unique name, even if it is a direct clone of another repository. The basic form of this qualification combines a person or organisation and a thing, device, system, convention, protocol or infrastructure. The base name for all the copies of `JQuery` is `jquery/JQuery`. The left hand part of the name is a person or an organisation, in this case, the JQuery organisation or the [jQuery Foundation](https://jquery.org/), while the right hand part points to the code itself, code that will inevitably contain many further named elements that need not concern us here. The name of a repository always combines a person or organisation (`BBC`, `Google`, `Twitter`, `WhiteHouse`, `torvalds`, etc.) and a thing (`jQuery`, `bootstrap`. `linux`, `dotfile`, etc.). Many repositories differ from each other _only_ in name. That is, some thousands of the `jQuery` repositories will be strictly speaking _clones_ of the primary `jQuery/jQuery` (or the jQuery Foundation's primary `jQuery` repository) differentiated only by the person or organisation with whom they are  concatenated. Thus the fully qualified name of repository inextricably points in more than one direction. It does not index or symbolise either people or things but always a concatenation of organisation/person/device/thing.

Such concatenations are familiar in science and technology studies accounts of technologies and scientific knowledges (since they, for instance, lie at the base of actor-network theory accounts of translation and displacement [@Callon_1983] or human-machine configurations [@Suchman_2006]). They do, however, intensify in contemporary infrastructures because the very operation of the thing/device/system/framework/protocol/tool/technique and the position assigned to the subjects who make statements about the infrastructure come much closer together and indeed mingle in code. Strictly speaking, the subject position marked by the left hand end of a Github repository name overflows the  `/` that separates it from the body of code that addresses devices or systems on the right hand side. The situation here is captured well in Michel Foucault's account of the constituting and generating operations of statements in _The Archaeology of Knowledge_:

> In each case the position of the subject is linked to the existence of an operation that is both determined and present; in each case, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation (he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it; he who posits the existence of a finite series is also, and at the same time, he who states it) ; and in each case, the subject links, by means of this operation and the statement in which it is embodied , his future statements and operations (as an enunciating subject, he accepts this statement as his own law) [@Foucault_1972, 94-95].

Repositories comprise sequences of statements instituting the operating limits, the patterns of inscription and transcription, the regularities and usages that comprise infrastructures in practice. These statements take effect, or implement something only through the coincidence that Foucault describes here. The subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation, Foucault claims (and he is describing here what he terms a 'discursive formation').  This is reminiscent of more recent accounts of performativity and things, but the embodiment of the operation in the statement -- and effectively I am suggesting that the repository name refers to such statements -- also mobilises future statements and operations. How so, in terms of what happens on  Github repositories?

One way to discriminate this linking of subjects and operations appears in all the repository names associated with `jQuery` that are not simply clones of the `jquery/jquery` repository. That is, the vast majority of the repository names in which `jquery` appears also contain some other name. Composite names comprise much of the proliferating bulk on  Github at various levels. For instance, names such as:

```
jquery-postcode-anywhere
jquery-bingsearch
select2-json-php-mysql-bootstrap-jquery
jquery-django-formset
twitter-jquery-plugin
```

display a range of infrastructural compositions occurring around `jquery`, ranging from postal address systems (postcodes) through web search engines, layers in the internet stack (web servers, databases, web frameworks) and social media platforms. This sample of composite names is by no means representative since much of the compositional semiosis around `jquery` pivots on individual elements of webpage user interfaces such as forms, menus, scrollbars and so on. Whether they stick closely to the graphic display of text and image or range more widely into the linkages between infrastructural layers, the combinatory composition that begins to appear in these repository names operates much more widely in mobilising infrastructures. Very easily, I suggest, we could find imitative and combinatory fluxes running across the millions of repositories on Github just at this banal level of names and naming. Other imitative and combinatory fluxes run much more deeply through the elements of coding, configuring, maintaining and repair work going on in the code.

## 'Dev-ops' and continuous building: when making infrastructures becomes operating infrastructures 

Deeper fluxes are not easy to see in the nominalistic semiosis described above. They might be discerned however by selecting from amongst the millions of named repositories on Github some of those that relate not so much to the design and construction of software but to its deployment, maintenance and repair. Amidst the millions of repositories on Github, disrepair and abandonment are extremely common. Repositories that contain a few items uploaded at some date are extremely common, as are repositories that have not been touched for months or years. By contrast, some repositories on Github show almost continuous patterns of contribution (developers adding or modifying the code), and others, perhaps fewer again, are not only often modified but constantly copied.[^j1] As we have seen earlier, the copying of a repository through the operation of forking or cloning is extremely common amongst developers, but the kind of copying in question here is not for the purposes of development by further coding. It is cloning for operational deployment. Such repositories serve different purposes than software development, or at least, they change how we might understand software development.

On the hand, they often contain specialised code focused on configuration of devices, systems, other software, services, and platforms. On the other hand, this specialized information is itself subject to generalization by virtue of its inclusion in a software repository. Configuration repositories are abound on Github because they allow the often intricate configuration details of contemporary software systems to be replicated quickly. Given that the scale of much information infrastructure is predicated on replicating the same thing multiple times, these configuration repositories reposition the management of infrastructure much closer to software development (e.g. a data-centre might be understood as a collection of identical computers linked together in ways that permit their processing to be coordinated and divided in many different ways; 'identical' here, however means managed through processes of replication.) Perhaps the most straightforward example of this somewhat recursive aspect of configuration would be the repository `github/github.` This repository name is not publicly visible on  Github, yet its existence underpins the ongoing life and dynamism of Github as a social coding platform. As the several hundred developers employed by  Github modify, add or repair elements of the platform itself, their changes flow into the operation of Github  through continuous deployment routines that draw down changes from the `github/Github`. Devops -- development operations - blurs the line between making and running, between designing and maintaining. We could also identify much more mundane versions of devops-style processes occurring in many repositories on Github. The many repositories containing names such 'dot' or 'dotfiles' or 'conf' do something similar at the level of individual developers development configuration. That is, they ensure a common and stable development environment for software developers amidst the many different configuration options possible (in relation to editors, compilers, file systems and various elements of the infrastructure that have to be rendered locally operable so that development for larger scale deployments can occur). 

[^j1]: Detecting repositories on Github that display this continuous development is not straightforward and involves some use of digital methods. In this case, I made use of the GithubArchive.org datasets as published in the Google BigQuery `GithubArchive` dataset. See http://bigquery.google.com/githubarchive [TBA - check url]

'Dev-ops' or developing-operating continuously re-fashion infrastructures through continuous deployment. The increasing elision of any difference between making and operating is a striking feature of such infrastructures, and one that may affect the mode of existence of infrastructures more generally. Different infrastructural figures such as 'the platform,' 'the stack,' 'deployment' and 'build' intersect with various organisational, aesthetic, ethical and commercial regimes of engagement. A  combination of different materials ranging from images, texts, cloud or distributed computing services, various database and search engines, through to code repositories with their groups of contributors comprise the loose but interwoven infrastructures typical of such platforms.  They hold together in relational patterns that arise from recursive practice. 

## Github itself - an island or an archipelago

Where does this leave Github itself? If I have been arguing that the combinatorial delirium generated by NSA-O-Matic is infrastructurally relevant and resonant for us today because it shows how many things can be seen as compounded or composited almost typographically, does the specific infrastructure of a platform like Github belong to this process or simply support it?  Is Github, then, a hub because it somehow has captured the nominalistic semiosis, or somehow made itself into the sinkhole of this semiosis? If Github attracts tremendous amounts of code (for instance, Google Corporation recently announced the closure of its own code repository service Google.code.com and migration of all code deposited there to Github [@Google_2015]; Microsoft Corporation has recently opened the source code of Windows, its main product, on Github, etc.), should we understand this as evidence of the success of Github in controlling the flows of code and coding work? To put the question more metaphorically, is Github a logistical success story (say like Singapore's role in container shipping) or a tremendous organic accumulation (say like Lagos in Nigeria, with its complicated flows of people, trade, oil and politics)? If we understand Github itself in terms of the nominalistic semiosis, then neither of these alternatives are quite right. Like many platforms, services, devices and systems, Github can be seen as an infrastructure, an infrastructure used in this case for software development and deployment.  In this respect, Github is somewhat like a logistics hub. It socially containerises code and allows it to move much flexibly and speedily. Code and coding itself might be seen as re-globalised in their Github transformation. But this logistical management does not capture the tremendous morass of abandoned, rarely used, ephemeral, miscellaneous and incredibly specific code and coding found there. 

## Conclusion

Infrastructures are mundane or sublime, I have been suggesting that in the case of software-affected infrastructures at least that names and naming practices help us practically engage with the full-stack complexities of contemporary infrastructures. Names in their linkages of people and devices, of 'dev' understood as a person, the software developer, and 'dev' as a common abbreviation for device, flow widely and deeply in contemporary software development. They attest to different and often overlapping movements. The imitative fluxes of names point to processes of replication and copying that propagate devices, protocols, standards and things in various configurations. I suggested that in contemporary information infrastructures, the form of the stack presents one organising axis of this propagation. But this layered architecture is viscously mixed in the concatenated names of many of the repositories on  Github. Both the replication of particular forms - `linux`, `jquery` - and their mutating combination can be seen in the repository names. 

Names not only provide a methodological traction on the infrastructural flux associated with software and coding practices, giving us some sense of the relative centrings and the predominant infrastructural rituals of our worlds. They operate generatively in several different senses.  First of all, the very act of naming every collection of code, code that may or may not do something in the world, implies an increasing addressability of diverse bodies of code. This addressability supports and engenders what I have been calling, loosely following Peirce, nominalistic semiosis. Second, the expansion of what is called a code repository to include almost any aspect of the structure, configuration, documentation and coordination of work associated with contemporary infrastructures means that the same regime of addressing in order to operate can generalization. Hence infrastructures increasingly unfurl by virtue of an ostensibly superficial nominalistic pragmatism. Third, this nominalistic semiosis is somewhat indifferent to distinctions between making and using, between design and deployment, and indeed to differences between what people and devices do. Across all of these distinctions, naming and calling by name operate interchangeably. This indifference or re-drawn difference between people and infrastructures generates a constant unfurling deployment in time and space. It lends itself to replication and variation, to changes in scale and variations in configuration. Devops epitomises one highly distilled version of the nominalistic semiosis of infrastructure.  

Following on from both STS work on infrastructures and media theory accounts of embodied time-space, it makes sense to see these unfurlings as also generating spaces and times, and not simply located in space and time. Unfurling is result of the relatively heterogeneous and diverse scales stacked on each other to generate relative durations and extended replications. Yet this unfurling makes times and spaces as well since it derives from new forms of holding-together assayed by naming and addressing named things. This unfurling may be very predictable, and it may also be shaped by imaginaries (of the cloud, of mobile communication, of pervasive computing), but it will also bring to light new forms of holding together. The continuous building of devops would be one example of this.
