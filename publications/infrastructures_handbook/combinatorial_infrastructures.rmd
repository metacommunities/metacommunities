## questions from cfp

- Scholarship from science and technology studies, anthropology, urban geography, media studies and continental philosophy have challenged the dualist foundations upon which the conventional understanding of infrastructure rests. Shared among these scholars, is a view of infrastructures as complex, dynamic and fragile assemblages.
- How do you **methodologically** engage and analytically conceive of infrastructure. What conceptual genealogies do you draw on?
- Empirically how are you **specifying the infrastructural:** what is an infrastructure, for whom and in relation to what specific practices?   
- What constitutes the **specific infrastructural assemblage** with which you are concerned? What do infrastructures hold together (materials, institutions, practices, discourses, etc.) What is the stuff of a specific infrastructural arrangement?
- How are things **held together** (practices, techniques, relationships, standards, norms)? What are the modes of translation and/or conversion that a specific infrastructural form/dynamic implies?
- How do you engage the **emergent and unforeseeable** qualities of infrastructure, what we might call their experimental qualities?
    - How do infrastructures shape futures? What are the temporalities of the infrastructure? 
    - How do infrastructures shape new worlds or ontologies.  
    - How do infrastructures make space and create new scales of social interaction
    - What are the limits of infrastructure (where do they end, for whom, how and why)?
    - What are the materialities of infrastructure and what is their relation to ideals like discourses, visions, plans.
    - What is the relation between emergent infrastructures, new forms of politics and forms of social change, including resistance.

## todo

- what's in a name? names as infrastructurally important because they hold together and allow experiment ..



## abstract

>    Recently released NSA documents revealed the existence of FOXSCORE, a massive database that bugs traffic from major internet exchanges. General Keith Alexander, Director of the National Security Agency, assured the public that the program is rubber stamped by a secret court. (http://divergentdave.github.io/nsa-o-matic/)

The NSA-o-matic is a very small piece of code that generates **names** of potential US NSA (National Security Agency) information infrastructures. We know from the files released by Edward Snowden something of the existence of sprawling cyber-security infrastructures such as XKEY, TREASUREMAP, and so forth [TBA - some of the recent literature on this]. One of the problems in making sense of contemporary communication infrastructures is the sheer variety of channels, modalities, platforms, scales of operation and levels of infrastructural interdependency. The Snowden revelations, in all their confusing variety, attest to a kind of combinatorial delirium in generating new ways of interacting with infrastructures. The NSA-O-Matic plays on this combinatorial process to generate the names of possible NSA infrastructures. The humour of the NSA-O-Matic derives partly from the disparity between the seemingly endless panoply of surveillance infrastructures with tendrils into every aspect of contemporary communications (wireless routers, skype conversations, network hubs, mobile phone conversations, social media, email messages, etc.) and the democratically-mandated authority of government figures such as General Keith Alexander or Senator Dianne Feinstein, and the perfunctory and weak oversight associated with the public assurance. The hard infrastructure of communication and the soft infrastructure of justice or government seem radically misaligned. 

This situation is not unique to the NSA or government intelligence agencies of a similar ilk. Indeed, their assiduous and passionate commitment to infrastructural access is well and truly part of the contemporary combinatorial processes I would like to focus on here. NSA-O-Matic points to a more general situation or to a problem that elicits many different responses, on various scales across diverse cultural and social spheres. There is no single logic to the combinatorial exuberance at work in networked communication infrastructures, since it is the product of multiple determinations. We might look at the sheer abundance of 'apps,' relatively small pieces of software that connect mobile devices like phones into global-scale computing and communication infrastructures as another site of the combinatorial exuberance.
The trick that NSA-O-Matic plays with communication infrastructures depends on  names, and naming practices actually, I would suggest provide a methodologically viable way of working with

An anonymous administration source assured the public that the program would only be used in the event of a national emergency. (http://divergentdave.github.io/nsa-o-matic/)

While strenuous and important efforts are being made to map the connections between the NSA's 'programs' and the communications and computing infrastructures that many of us use daily, it might be worth staying close to the practices that generate the combinations that NSA-O-Matic amusingly generates. It is quite difficult for social researchers to study TREASUREMAP or XKEY directly, but there are infrastructural interstices where the combinatorial play can be mapped a little more: code repositories. This contribution will principally explore how we might think about infrastructures as cultural processes using coding repositories. It will do this by describing how certain infrastructures are increasingly made as and through software or code. It approaches software less in terms of digital media or control system, and more in terms of software as a permeable material threaded through many different media, communication, administrative and operational infrastructures. The conceptual genealogies I draw on include science and technology studies accounts of information and scientific data infrastructures [@Bowker_2005; @Edwards_2011], as well as anthropological accounts of software in terms of recursion and freedom [@Kelty_2008; @Coleman_2013] (although it lies quite a long way from debates about open vs closed source code, the debate that monopolised attention to software during much of the last decade).

The specific infrastructures I plan to discuss are the code repository platform Github.com with its millions of software repositories sprawling across many domains. It is rather like NSA-O-Matic writ large, since the millions of code repositories not only address almost any kind of digital hardware and software one can imagine, but also because it is full of the same combinatorial delirium that NSA-O-Matic plays with. The infrastructural dimensions of Github will be empirically specified in terms of the bodies of code that Gibhub's own software developers create and modify as they operate Github as a platform. Put more technically, the empirical focus is on the role of 'dev-ops' or developing-operating as a way of continuously re-fashioning infrastructures through continuous deployment. The increasing elision of any difference between making and operating is a striking feature of such infrastructures, and one that may affect the mode of existence of infrastructures more generally. The entry will explore how different infrastructural figures such as 'the platform,' 'the stack,' 'deployment' and 'build' intersect with various organisational, aesthetic, ethical and commercial regimes of engagement. A  combination of different materials ranging from images, texts, cloud or distributed computing services, various database and search engines, through to code repositories with their groups of contributors comprise the loose but interwoven infrastructures typical of such platforms.  They are hold together, I will suggest, in relational patterns that arise from recursive practice. The striking feature of platforms for software development is how much software development they attract in their own right. This recursive generation of patterned combinations, however, could be understood formally, but I will develop an account of the recursive practices that suggests how they occur when the line between making and operating infrastructures becomes unstable.

## ideas

- is assemblage thinking addressing what is happening today?
- who or what is infrastructure: lots of people or organisations call themselves infrastructure (the query here)
- github is like a small, high-tech island -- a Singapore or a Lagos of the internet -- tremendous amounts of sophisticated affluence surrounded by a morain of service, administrative, maintenance and individual projects (something like the night markets in Singapore as a trace of former panoply)
- infrastructures as superimposed global, like a global variable (Ong & Collier) -- become an important referent -- but actual practices that cannot simply refer to a static global variable. 
- the commit, diff, push and pull, clone and fork operations that define the writing of code might also be images of the actual assemblages that we encounter -- increasingly infrastructures are written; 
- snowden revelations about nsa suggest a kind of combinatorial generation of infrastructures, in which systems, machines, etc are stacked on top of each other
- data centres and their management as a critical infrastructure in multiple ways -- security, business, but access and participation -- but also in the way that they have generated new circuits of infrastructural work that tends to combinatorial contagions. 
- devops as a symptom of the change in the nature of infrastructres in that repair and maintenance are impossible to separate from experimentation and innovation (cf Google article on their experimental approach)
- github itself as an infra-infrastructure that seeks to cope with what people do -- can only use recursion to do this
- infrastructures as attempts to organise the field of participation and to organise social relations in global assemblages
- infrastructures are sense-making processes (with the double play on sense -- direction and perception)

## extract stuff

We know that infrastructures are written or inscribed all the way down, or almost all the way down. That is, contemporary infrastructures, especially those affected by information technology (I promise to use that term only once) are generated, configured and maintained by reading and writing things. Given that in many settings, the so-affected infrastructures are the actual norm, the process of reading and writing infrastructures matters greatly in the form of software. This is not to say that water, sanitation, energy, transport, communication, waste and environmental control infrastructures -- the so-called 'hard' infrastructures -- are actually 'soft', in the sense of software. One could say just the opposite and point out that the so-called 'soft' infrastructures of  police, government, justice, the military, education, health, or science -- are not thoroughly material.
