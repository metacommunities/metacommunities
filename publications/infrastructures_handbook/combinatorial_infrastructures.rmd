The NSA-o-matic is a toy piece of code that generates *names* of fictional US NSA (National Security Agency) infrastructures by colligating names of devices, systems, protocols and standards and naming them with proper names compounded from actually existing infrastructures. We know from the files released by Edward Snowden something of the existence of sprawling cyber-security infrastructures such as XKEY, TREASUREMAP, SKYNET and so forth [@CJFE_2015], all of which might be broadly understood as knowledge infrastructures.  The Snowden revelations, in all their confusing variety, attest to a kind of combinatorial delirium in generating new ways of knowing with infrastructures. The humour of NSA-O-Matic derives partly from the disparity between the existence of a seemingly technically far-fetched juxtapositions -- USB hardware that deanonymizes communications satellites? -- and our still somewhat inchoate and stunned knowledge of infrastructures growing tendrils into every aspect of contemporary communications (wireless routers, skype conversations, network hubs, mobile phone conversations, social media, email messages, etc.). The public assurances extracted from U.S. government figures such as General Keith Alexander or Senator Dianne Feinstein only emphasise the threadbare democratic mandate for the existence of such systems.  The hard infrastructure of communication and the soft infrastructure of justice or government seem radically misaligned. 

The combinatorial delirium is not unique to the NSA or government intelligence agencies of a similar ilk. One of the problems in knowing infrastructures is the sheer variety of channels, devices, standards, modalities, platforms, scales of operation and levels of interdependency. The assiduous commitment of government security agencies to infrastructural access epitomises contemporary combinatorial processes. NSA-O-Matic points to a more general situation or to a process  that elicits many different responses, on various scales across diverse cultural and social spheres. There is no single logic to the combinatorial exuberance at work in networked communication infrastructures, since it is the product of multiple determinations. We might look at the sheer abundance of 'apps,' relatively small pieces of software that connect mobile devices like phones into global-scale computing and communication infrastructures as another site of the combinatorial exuberance.

NSA-O-Matic spoofs knowledge of putative infrastructures. It relies on names to evoke the opacity and depth of infrastructures. While  important efforts are being made to map the connections between NSA 'programs' named in the Snowden documents and specific communications and computing infrastructures that many of us use daily [@GuardianNews_2015], it might be worth staying close to the combinatorial play of NSA-O-Matic.  We might apprehend something of the  unfurling,  unstable opacity of contemporary infrastructures by examining only the names of their constituent fragments, fragments that may attest to the splintering [@Graham_2001] but also to the naturalisation of infrastructures [@Bowker_1999, 326].  If, like NSA-O-Matic, we apprehend infrastructures by name only, how do infrastructures appear to us? Somewhat inverse to tendencies to see depth and scale as the underpinning power dynamic,  infrastructures display _nominalistic semiosis_.[^c.1] All infrastructures, no matter how subterranean, act semiotically. The rusted bolts, the cracked concrete plinths, the stanchions, bars, girders, plugs, cables, stone, steel, glass, rubber, oil, plastic, electricity, gas and springs participate in semiosis.  They function through indexes: rust suggests moisture, cloudy or black oil suggests wear, a buzzing indicates a process, etc., to infrastructural interpretants.  So too diagrams accompany infrastructures, and on diagrams labels designate components, processes, flows and structures. While we might approach knowledge infrastructures in terms of the growth of forms such as 'platforms' [@Gillespie_2010] or increasingly programmed or protocol control [@Beniger_1986; @Galloway_2004], perhaps their consistency and variety owes much to the diagrams that connect and combine named entities that thread through many different media, communication, administrative and operational practices. Naming practices offer a viable way of navigating the densely trafficked archipelagos of code, protocols, standards, devices,  statements and operations shaping infrastructures in practices. 

## Mapping infrastructures in name

Where can infrastructural semiosis be studied? In online code repositories,  naming constitutes a primary form of designation, manipulation and operation. All code inhabits name spaces.[^d.2]  Code repositories store the source code, associated documents, files, configuration information and a variety of other materials associated with software.[^d.1] Methodologically speaking, focusing on names might seem a bit counter-productive, since attention to  materiality, devices, things, non-human actors and practice in general been one of the hallmarks of the social studies of infrastructure. In the case of code-based infrastructures (and code inflects almost all knowledge infrastructures today), naming is a crucial practice. Naming operationally links people and things, places and devices together in complicated associations.

The largest repository of code, the code repository platform (Github.com)[http://www.github.com] with around 20 million repositories  (in 2015) sprawling across many domains, epitomises nominalistic semiosis.   Github is rather like NSA-O-Matic writ large, since the code repositories it hosts not only address almost any kind of digital hardware and software practice one can imagine, but seem to be animated in their growth since 2007 by the same combinatorial delirium that NSA-O-Matic, itself a Github-hosted project, displays. It is difficult to characterise the heterogeneity of things, devices, conventions, platforms and organisations named in Github code repositories, and indeed, this difficulty is one of the motivations to approach what happens there in terms of names. Not all Github code repositories can be read as infrastructures, including several thousand repositories simply called `infrastructure`. But many of them, ranging from operating system such as `Linux` to code libraries for managing cloud-based deployments (`puppet`, `chef`, etc.) exhibit infrastructural becomings. 

Github itself looks like a typical contemporary social media platform.  It has many of the appurtenances of participation ('followers', 'groups', 'watchers', 'stars', etc.;) and invokes the ethico-economic injunction to 'share' [@John_2013].  Github seeks to render coding itself 'social.'   It treats coding as a social practice of participation, somehow akin to photo-sharing or chatting with friends using a social media platform. In this respect,  infrastructures become the objects of social rituals and enactments.  The trappings of social media and its imperatives -- 'be social, share code' -- with their focus on networks of relations between people largely occlude the tremendous combinatorial processes occurring on Github and `git`-like platforms more generally. The fluxes of imitation of names and their recombinant energy constantly overflow the imperative to 'be social.' 

If we could see, as we cannot, just the names of repositories hosted on Github in 2015, we would encounter a baffling polysemy. Repository names on Github can be any combination of letters or characters. These range from the almost casually random, yet still recognisable names such as  `asdf` (the first four characters on the home-row of an English keyboard) or `1234`, both of which number in their thousands through to highly recognisable names such as `linux` or `apache.` Both of the latter projects are well-known as key infrastructural elements of contemporary digital networks, the `linux` kernel in particular representing one of the main ways in which coding work has become more visible as a cultural and social practice [@Coleman_2012; @Kelty_2008; @Mackenzie_2006], and practically permeates the information infrastructural *stack*.[^g.01] 

Between the two extremes of the random keypress repositories and the installed bulk of `linux` or `apache` lies a very diverse and dense population of names.   Read serially in their spread and diversification over time, these names diagram infrastructures multiplying, combining, and decaying in layers. Processes of repair, re-invention, appropriation, capitalisation and speculation are engrained in the distribution of names. The gamut of names of Github repositories, enough to populate a small country, is somewhat heterogeneous, pluralistic and full of transient multiplicities, but axes of organisation and centralisation that assemble infrastructural elements into something like the 'full stack' associated with the digital networks can be discerned there. On the one hand, the distance between repositories called 'asdf' and 'linux' is great. The former typically represent ephemeral contacts between individuals and infrastructures (for instance, many such repositories are the traces of people trying out or learning to use Github) and the latter encompass information network architectonics resulting from much collective effort. On the other hand, movement along the axis between ephemeral and durable (the `linux` repository has been hosted on Github since 2007[^1]) is relatively easy on Github itself.  The Github  platform, with its infrastructures for storage, searching, tracking and graphing of coding work, arrays all repositories on the same surface. In this respect, it renders all differences superficial, and this superficiality is perhaps a somewhat novel experience.

Infrastructures like Github allocate all things a position in a common _namespace_. Nearly all code heavily relies on naming practices. Whether viewed as a series of statements, commands or functions, naming and the forms of address associated with names weave inextricably through software. It is only more recently, however, that the relations and connections between disparate bodies of code of many different ilk have all started to take place in a common namespace. Naming practices themselves, moreover, display specificities that might help us analyse the differences and associations between people and infrastructures are re-iteratively re-drawn. For instance, on Github, the names of code repositories when fully specified have a number of components. Take the 70,000 or so repositories whose names include the term `JQuery`.`JQuery` is a software library that web developers use to design the kinds of interactive webpages full of buttons, animations, dynamics menus, etc. that we associate with say browsing the web or buying a train ticket online. The details of `JQuery` need not concern us here, but it is interesting that its popularity amongst web developers -- more than 50% of all websites were making use of it in 2012 [@W3Techs_2012] -- arises from the way that it allows webpages written in HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML) to be manipulated as a set of named elements. In other words, `JQuery` subjects the display screen as a set of named elements subject to operations. Statements written using `JQuery` operate to generate text and graphics that people read, scroll, click, and select. This relatively banal example of how a page becomes a field of named entities pertains much more generally.  If for instance we turn to the much more obviously infrastructural operations of something like Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute 2 (AWS EC2), something similar appears. The approximately 21,000  Github repositories relating to AWS EC2 display a great range of concerns, but nearly all offer ways of naming and addressing instances of `linux` services running in Amazon's data centres. These may be implemented in different programming languages -- Haskell, Ruby, Python, Java or Javascript -- and many different naming conventions permeate these different languages, but all of them rely subject the operation of elements in AWS EC2 to invocations.

[^1]: An analysis of the pre-2007 trajectory of `linux` as a body of code can be found in [@Mackenzie_2006, Chapter 4].

[^g.01]: The stack comprises a diverse range of materials that could include storage systems (disk drives), servers, network resources, hardware specificities, data models and database architectures, business and transactional logics, software frameworks that connect elements of systems and architectures together, user interfaces including how screen elements such as graphics, interactive devices and text operate together. The first four layers of this stack, for instance, would be dominated by `linux` kernel versions, since the Android operating system, which has the largest installed base, is a version of `linux`. Or, if we turned from handheld devices to supercomputers, 97% reportedly use `linux.` This is clearly a repository of no little significance.  While `apache` is perhaps less well-known, it has for over a decade now has served the largest share of websites (around 40% or 340 million sites in January 2015 [@Netcraft_2015]).

[^c.1]: In 'Pragmatism in Retrospect: a Last Formulation,' C.S. Peirce writes, 'by semiosis, I mean ... an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of _three_ subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs' [@Peirce_1955, 282].  He goes on to note that the interpretant, the entity affected by an encounter with a sign is not necessarily a person, although it is easier to think about semiosis in terms of people. 

[^d.1]: The practices of working with code repositories on Github are quite complicated, and not the focus on discussion here. The advent of the `git` approach to the management of code has led to a very wide-ranging set of changes in the production of code, and Github has become the 'largest code repository on the planet' [@Git_2014] by centralising some of these shifts. Software engineering researchers have taken a keen interest in these repositories precisely because they seem to offer access to how software is actually built [@Takhteyev_2010; @Thung_2013]. 

[^d.2]: Code and coding have been widely discussed as making contemporary infrastructure what it is. The conceptual genealogies I draw on include science and technology studies accounts of information and scientific data infrastructures [@Bowker_2005; @Edwards_2011], as well as anthropological accounts of software in terms of recursion and freedom [@Kelty_2008; @Coleman_2013] (although it lies quite a long way from debates about open vs closed source code, the debate that monopolised attention to software during much of the last decade) and connections between network infrastructure and contemporary urban experience [@Graham_2001; @Thrift_2014].
