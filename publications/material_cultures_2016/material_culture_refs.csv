It approaches these geographies in two ways. First, it views foods not only as placed cultural artefacts, but also as dis-placed materials and practices, inhabiting many times and spaces which, far from being neatly bounded, bleed into and mutually constitute each other. Second, it considers the geographical knowledges, or understandings, of foods' geographies, mobilized within circuits of culinary culture, outlining their production through processes of commodity fetishism, and arguing for forms of critical intervention that work with the fetish rather than attempt to reach behind it.									207	0	0	3	3	209			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77300001	
J	Ingold, T								Culture on the ground - The world perceived through the feet								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				9	3			315	340		10.1177/1359183504046896			NOV 2004	2004	Classical accounts of human evolution posit a progressive differentiation between the hands as instruments of rational intelligence and feet as integral to the mechanics of bipedal locomotion. Yet evolutionists were modelling pedestrian performance on the striding gait of boot-clad Europeans. The bias of head over heels in their accounts follows a long-standing tendency, in western thought and science, to elevate the plane of social and cultural life over the ground of nature. This tendency was already established among European elites in the practice of destination-oriented travel, the use of shoes and chairs, and the valorization of upright posture. It was further reinforced in urban societies through paving the streets. The groundlessness of metropolitan life remains embedded not only in western social structures but also in the disciplines of anthropology, psychology and biology. A more grounded approach to human movement, sensitive to embodied skills of footwork, opens up new terrain in the study of environmental perception, the history of technology, landscape formation and human anatomical evolution.									112	0	0	3	2	112			1359-1835			WOS:000225270800005	
J	DeSilvey, Caitlin				Thomas, Nicola/C-6206-2015				Observed decay: Telling stories with mutable things								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				11	3			318	338		10.1177/1359183506068808			NOV 2006	2006	The degradation of cultural artefacts is usually understood in a purely negative vein: the erosion of physical integrity is associated with a parallel loss of cultural information. This article asks if it is possible to adopt an interpretive approach in which entropic processes of decomposition and decay, though implicated in the destruction of cultural memory traces on one register, contribute to the recovery of memory on another register. The article tracks the entanglement of cultural and natural histories through the residual material culture of a derelict homestead in Montana. In conclusion, the article suggests that deposits of degraded material, though inappropriate for recovery in conventional conservation strategies, may be understood through the application of a collaborative interpretive ethic, allowing other-than-human agencies to participate in the telling of stories about particular places.									78	0	0	0	1	79			1359-1835			WOS:000242441800003

J	Parkin, D								Mementoes as transitional objects in human displacement								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	3			303	320					NOV 1999	1999	This article argues for a theoretical extension in anthropology from the post-Cartesian depiction of body and mind as one (rather than as separable) to the idea that this composite body-mind can be regarded as enmeshed in social trails created by the movement of objects. Movements of persons therefore occur with or in relation to the objects to which people attach themselves. Such everyday movements need to be contrasted with those dramatically resulting from forcible human displacement, in which refugees, for instance, take what items they can both for immediate practical use but also in order either to re-establish or re-define personal and collective origins. The article concludes by suggesting that, as mementoes of sentiment and cultural knowledge and yet also as bases of future re-settlement, the 'transitional objects' carried by peoples in crisis inscribe their personhood in flight but offer the possibility of their own de-objectification and re-personalization afterwards.									62	0	0	2	1	63			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200004

The yet to be disposed of objects in ruins have been identified as 'waste', an assignation which testifies to the power of some to normatively order the world, but also is part of an excess, impossible to totally erase, which contains rich potential for reinterpretation and reuse because it is under-determined. Through processes of decay and non-human intervention, objects in ruins gradually transform their character and lose their discreteness, they become charged with alternative aesthetic properties, they impose their materiality upon the sensory experience of visitors, and they conjure up the forgotten ghosts of those who were consigned to the past upon the closure of the factory but continue to haunt the premises. In these ways, ruined matter offers ways for interacting otherwise with the material world.									60	0	0	1	0	60			1359-1835			WOS:000233337900005

It reflects upon the relations between human and natural sciences, the nature of appeals between them, and the important, but often questionable, place within this of particular political positions. It goes on to query the role of 'Nature' as a grounding to place and landscape and stresses the potentially differential effectivities of contrasting temporalities - between, for example, the temporalities of the taskspace and the temporalities of tectonics. Nonetheless, the argument continues, there are indeed provocations from the moving rocks to the nature of scientific discourse and to debates within political philosophy. It concludes with a conceptualization of both landscape and place as events.

J	Gell, A								Vogel's net - Traps as artworks and artworks as traps								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	1			15	38		10.1177/135918359600100102			MAR 1996	1996	This essay explores the basis of the distinction commonly made between works of art or art objects, and 'mere' artefacts, which are useful but not aesthetically interesting or beautiful. It is argued that if the art object is identifiable as such in the light of the fact that it has an interpretation, as Danto claims, then many artefacts could be exhibited as art objects. The essay shows that animal traps could very well be exhibited as art, because they tend to embody complex ideas and intentions to do with the relationship between men and animals, and because they provide a model of the hunter himself and his idea of the world of the prey animal. It is concluded that an aesthetic definition of the art object is consequently unsatisfactory.									53	0	0	1	5	58			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77200001	
J	Shove, E; Southerton, D								Defrosting the freezer: From novelty to convenience - A narrative of normalization								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	3			301	319					NOV 2000	2000	This article examines the 'normalization' of the British freezer. It defines three phases in this process: an initial period oriented around the utility of preserving home produce; a second stage marked by the development of a frozen food infrastructure and the establishment of the freezer as a part of the efficient domestic economy; and a third subtle but significant redefinition of the primary benefits of freezing in terms of convenience. Cast in their new role as 'time machines', freezers are sold as a means of managing contemporary pressures associated with the scheduling and co-ordination of domestic life. At one level, this is a story of the gradual acceptance of a relatively standardized object. Yet this narrative suggests that the freezer's promised benefits and functions change along the way. Developing this point, we argue that the normalization of the chameleon-like freezer can only be understood in the context of similarly changing systems of food provisioning, patterns of domestic practice and allied technological devices.									54	0	0	3	0	54			1359-1835			WOS:000165460300003	
J	Marcoux, JS								The 'casser maison' ritual - Constructing the self by emptying the home								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			213	235					JUL 2001	2001	This paper addresses the relationship between mobility, ageing and death in an urban housing market from a material culture perspective. It examines a divestment ritual performed by elderly people in Montreal (Canada) on the occasion of a move from a home on their own to a care environment. This move which is often a move into a smaller place and a smaller set of things is also accompanied by the compulsion for the people to divest themselves of some of their belongings, a process that is called 'casser maison', literally 'breaking the house: This ethnographic paper reveals that 'casser maison' is not only a matter of getting separated from some, if not most, of one's possessions, however. It is also a matter of placing those possessions among the kin or other potential recipients. In this respect,'casser maison' pertains to a ritualized form of construction of the self through the emptying of the place. It proceeds from the wish to ancestralize oneself; the capacity to place one's possessions is taken to guarantee the survival of the subject and of his or her memory. As such, this paper demonstrates that, through the use of personal belongings, the divestment of the self becomes a form of investment.

J	Warnier, JP								A praxeological approach to subjectivation in a material world								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	1			5	24					MAR 2001	2001	This article aims at bringing together various lines of analysis that have been kept more or less separate until now, that is, studies on the body, motricity, perception, agency, material culture, the subject, unconscious drives, and power systems. By drawing on the work of Mauss, Schilder, Tisseron, Parlebas and Foucault, it discusses how the subject and its drives are invested in sensori-motricity in a material world. When it is socially validated and coded, such an investment amounts to what Foucault called the 'techniques of the self'. The subjectivation thus achieved may be consistent or at odds with corresponding representations. The notions provided by praxeology, the science of sensori-motricity, may help in producing an ethnography of subjectivation in a material world.									48	0	0	0	3	50			1359-1835			WOS:000167925200001

It argues that understanding light as a powerful social agent, in its relationship with people, things, colours, shininess and places, may facilitate an appreciation of the active social role of luminosity in the practice of day-to-day activities. The article surveys an array of past conceptions of light within philosophy, natural science and more recent approaches to light in the fields of anthropology and material culture studies. A number of implications are discussed, and by way of three case studies it is argued that light may be used as a tool for exercising social intimacy and inclusion, of shaping moral spaces and hospitality, and orchestrating movement, while working as a metaphor as well as a material agent in these social negotiations. The social comprehension of light is a means of understanding social positions in ways that may be real or imagined, but are bound up on the social and cultural associations of certain lightscapes.									43	0	0	3	1	44			1359-1835			WOS:000251394200003	
J	Knappett, C								Photographs, skeuomorphs and marionettes - Some thoughts on mind, agency and object								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	1			97	117		10.1177/1359183502007001307			MAR 2002	2002	The aim of this article is to investigate the agency of objects, a seemingly paradoxical statement within most recent western thought, in which agents and objects are sharply contrasted. However, in an important attempt to overcome the profound dichotomy between people and things, the observation that 'objects have social lives' has become something of a mantra in material culture studies. Yet rather more than a mantra is required if we are to move forward in our understanding of the complex workings of material culture; we need to investigate the potentially diverse processes whereby 'inanimate' objects come to be socially alive. To this end, an interdisciplinary approach is adopted that draws upon current research in archaeology, anthropology aesthetics, sociology, and cognitive psychology.									44	0	0	1	0	44			1359-1835			WOS:000174550500005

I suggest that the creation of large open spaces in city contexts, generating a marked contrast with local tolerance of crowding, represents the intrusive presence of regimentation and aesthetic domination. Within a larger pattern of conceding to hegemonic ideas about classical ornamentation as well as rational town-planning, such idioms of 'spatial cleansing' create a context entirely compatible with the current structures of economic inequality. They also occlude the understandings of past experience that characterize local groups wishing to remain in historic centers; it is noteworthy that in Thailand, where the middle class has not yet succumbed to the global fashion for antique domestic spaces as has its counterpart in Italy (and to a lesser extent in Greece), it is the poor who seem more interested in calibrating their lives to official master narratives in the hope of being rewarded with continued rights to inhabit their existing lived environment.

I examine goods purchased or made for the child-to-be during pregnancy; goods given from the child-to-be during the pregnancy; goods given to, or in the memory of, the 'baby' after its death; and things acquired to memorialize the child within the family. Through the buying, giving, and preserving of things, women and their social networks actively construct their babies-to-be and would-have-been babies as 'real babies' and themselves as 'real mothers', worthy of the social recognition this role entails.									41	0	1	0	1	43			1359-1835			WOS:000165460300004	
J	Witmore, Christopher L.								Vision, media, noise and the percolation of time - Symmetrical approaches to the mediation of the material world								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				11	3			267	292		10.1177/1359183506068806			NOV 2006	2006	Why in the articulation of archaeological knowledge have wider sensory properties of the material world been overlooked? This article considers this question in relation to sound. It argues that the neglect of sound is partly the product of human transactions with instruments and media in practice. Moreover, the denial of sound as a relevant category of archaeological inquiry arises out of modernist notions of space-time that reside at the heart of the discipline. So while the visual is linked with spatial properties that are resistant to change, the aural is connected with the temporal and is considered momentary and fleeting in nature. Still, it is argued that sound as a quality of things is fundamental to human sensation - to being. In building upon a non-modernist notion of time where entities and events quite distant in a linear temporality are proximate through their simultaneous entanglement and percolation I suggest we might learn what we can understand from tuning into the acoustic properties of the material past. But rather than reproduce an unnecessary dualism between seeing and hearing, this endeavor will require us to relearn how to see and hear at the same time through other, complimentary modes of articulation and engagement.

It links this concept to three key areas, the body, food and the landscape arguing that these are as much 'flags of identity' as are the more obvious symbols of national belonging: coins, costumes, anthems and ceremonies. It further states that these flags provide a system of reference within which aspects of the material world are used, consumed and experienced. It is, therefore, important to consider how this system operates so that a better understanding can be gained into how a sense of belonging and identity is communicated and maintained.									36	0	0	0	2	38			1359-1835			WOS:000075080900003	
J	Richards, C								Henges and water - Towards an elemental understanding of monumentality and landscape in late Neolithic Britain								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	3			313	336		10.1177/135918359600100303			NOV 1996	1996	This paper examines the adoption by archaeologists of perspectives of 'landscape' currently being explored in the social sciences. Despite an appreciation of the social construction of landscape and nature, it is suggested that generally archaeologists have failed to take account of the significance of the social identification of 'natural' constituents of the world. Virtually all societies identify particular 'elements' in the composition of the experienced world and cosmos. The importance of these elements is that they represent the basic substances from which everything is derived and to which everything decays (including humanity). Therefore, elements maintain ontological status and provide a potent symbolic medium of expression. Here the late Neolithic henge monuments of Britain, the architecture of which has defied archaeological interpretation, is examined in terms of a representation of landscape and a strategic deployment of 'elements'. In particular, the element of water is identified as being a major component in their architectural image and symbolic constitution. The henge monuments are shown to embody a physical representation of the local topography and to draw heavily on that topography to create a series of homologies of landscape. A crucial aspect of this observation is the suggestion that archaeologists have misconceived the visual appearance of henge monuments, particularly the probability that the enclosure ditches were receptacles for water. Furthermore, it is argued that the relationship between henges and rivers provides a metaphorical conjunction between the natural flowing of water and human movement into the monuments. It is hoped that this study will focus attention on the importance of the social constitution of nature and landscape, and the influence this may have on the materiality of architectural representation.									38	0	0	0	0	38			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77400003

Starting from what is identified as a dilemma in disposability, caught between two moral systems of the household - thrift and hygiene - this article discusses these systems in terms of waste and the activities surrounding it. Through examination of various practices and drawing on several examples and case studies, it is argued that the issue of disposability is intimately linked to consumption, specifically through the problem of inalienability and its effect on dispossession or the shedding off of domestic and personal objects.									36	0	0	1	0	36			1359-1835			WOS:000174550500001	
J	Gosselain, OP								In pots we trust - The processing of clay and symbols in sub-Saharan Africa								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	2			205	230					JUL 1999	1999	Previous studies have illustrated the symbolic prominence of pottery making in sub-Saharan Africa. In many parts of the continent, the craft is explicitly connected to a series of other production activities and parts of the technical process often serve as a metaphor for explaining aspects of the human experience and to structure certain rituals. Barley goes as far as to speak of a 'potting model', one of many ways available to a culture to think about itself. It remains to be known, however, why African people specifically chose pottery making as a way to act upon/explain the world and why the activity is connected to specific realms of the human experience throughout the continent. Also, one may wonder whether potters' behaviour could in turn be influenced by metaphors, with steps of the chaine operatoire becoming the locus of a symbolic discourse. In an effort to answer these questions, I attempted a systematic comparison of prohibitions and rituals connected to pottery in 102 sub-Saharan societies.									35	0	0	1	2	36			1359-1835			WOS:000081919400005

This paper contends that landscapes cannot simply be considered as a series of unidimensional spaces, rather they must be considered as composed of lived places. This paper sets out to explore the way in which places within the landscape are conceptually framed and constituted through the animal life which inhabits them. The association between certain animal species with different kinds of place is seen as a crucial element in the relationship between place, memory and identity. It is suggested that all these elements of the materiality of animals are important in considering the way in which animals are understood and appropriated by people. These ideas will be examined through the analysis of a series of deposits associated with animals within chambered tombs, passage graves and settlement middens of the late Neolithic period in Orkney.

A discussion of the consumption of clothing is used to demonstrate that this tendency involves confusing two logically distinct frames of analysis, the study of material objects and the study of actions. Two central differences between these frameworks are identified, that of the parameters of identity and the nature of meaning. The question of whether the purchase and wearing of items of clothing should be regarded as actions in the full sense is debated, as too is the claim that, even when known to be actions, they can be regarded as revealing choices between alternative life-styles or identities. It is concluded that determining 'the meaning' of an action is a far more complex and difficult process than seeking for 'the meaning' of an object.									33	0		13	0	33			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77200004

Prevalent around the globe, particularly among women, this movement is based locally in places such as hotels and cafes, and virtually using the internet. The women meet to knit, stitch and talk. The groups use new technologies as an enabler and resource exchange. At the same time, their presence can be seen, in part, as a negative response to major political, social and technological changes including globalization, terrorism, damage to the environment and the dislocation of the Information Society. We introduce five themes to assist in the development of a research agenda into this new form of material culture, discussing (1) remedial, (2) progressive, (3) resistance, (4) nostalgic and (5) ironic possibilities. Each is considered in terms of their respective foci on community, cyberfeminism, craft, conservation and comment.									32	0	0	0	0	32			1359-1835			WOS:000244936000001	
J	Strang, V								Common senses - Water, sensory experience and the generation of meaning								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				10	1			92	120		10.1177/1359183505050096			MAR 2005	2005	This article is concerned with the relationship between sensory experience, material realities and the creation of cross-cultural meanings. Focused on water, it offers a comparison of two, highly diverse, ethnographic examples: one an Aboriginal community living alongside the Mitchell River in Far North Queensland, and the other describing the groups inhabiting a river valley in the south of England. It considers how engagements with water are experienced and interpreted within these specific cultural contexts. Drawing on theoretical developments from studies of art and material culture, analyses of cross-cultural aesthetics, and accounts of how meanings are encoded in natural objects, it describes the formal qualities of water and human interactions with these. It suggests that two important 'universalities' - the particular qualities of water, and the physiological and cognitive processes that are common to all human beings - generate cross-cultural themes of meaning that persist over time and space. Thus the ethnographic analysis provides the basis for a discussion about the relationship between universal and cultural experiences, contributing to the critique of cultural relativism and suggesting a need for anthropological theory to recall its comparative foundations.									31	0	0	3	1	32			1359-1835			WOS:000227729700005	
J	Holtorf, C								Notes on the life history of a pot sherd								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	1			49	71		10.1177/1359183502007001305			MAR 2002	2002	This article discusses various life history approaches in archaeology: short life histories study the lives of things in the past (until they end up in the ground), long life histories study these lives going on until the present. Both approaches share the assumption that although people are free to give to a thing any meaning they want, their material essence necessarily remains unchanged. As an alternative, I present an ethnographic approach, studying the 'life' of a pot sherd on an excavation project. All the thing's properties and characteristics, including its material identity and age, are taken to be the outcome of processes taking place in the present. The data presented shows in some detail how 'momentary, fluid and flexible' archaeological classifications and interpretations of material culture are. It emerges that the material identities ascribed to things are not their essential properties but the result of specific relationships of people and things: their very materiality is potentially multiple and has a history.									32	0	0	1	1	32			1359-1835			WOS:000174550500003	
J	Miller, D								The fame of trinis: Websites as traps								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	1			5	24					MAR 2000	2000	This article attempts to demonstrate the value and insightful nature of the recent work of Alfred Gell through an application of his theoretical ideas on both Art and Agency to the study of Trinidadian websites. It examines both personal and commercial websites produced by Trinidadians and explores how their contents and aesthetic forms strive to attract and trap certain surfers while escaping the attention of those surfers who are not its intended viewers. Websites create an expanded space-time in which on analogy with Kula operators, their owners seek to create their fame and disperse their social efficacy.									31	0	0	10	1	32			1359-1835			WOS:000085507100001	
J	Hetherington, K				French, Shaun/B-1155-2010				Museum topology and the will to connect								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	2			199	218		10.1177/135918359700200203			JUL 1997	1997	This paper is concerned with the relationship between material culture and spatiality. Through the example of the ceramics collection in the City Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, England, an analysis is made of the topological character of space that is folded around certain objects on display. Ozzy the Owl, a 17th-century slipware owl jug, who was discovered on BBC TV's Antiques Roadshow in 1990 and subsequently bought by the museum, is seen as an agent that is constituted by the folding together of preface and afterword in the museum display, unsettling its (Euclidian) geometry, (Kantian) aesthetic and discourse of improvement (organized around Wedgwood). Ozzy brings complexity and connection; his contingent location within the museum's heterogeneous material network reveals the functional blankness of objects and the effect this can have in performing new topological arrangements in a space, revealing the friability and partial connectedness of its narrativity.

J	Williams, H								Death warmed up - The agency of bodies and bones in early Anglo-Saxon cremation rites								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				9	3			263	291		10.1177/135918350406894			NOV 2004	2004	It is argued that recent archaeological theories of death and burial have tended to overlook the social and mnemonic agency of the dead body. Drawing upon anthropological, ethnographic and forensic analogies for the effects of fire on the human body, together with Gell's theory of the agency of inanimate objects, the article explores the cremation rites of early Anglo-Saxon England. As a case study in the archaeological study of the mnemonic agency of bodies and bones it is suggested that cremation and postcremation rites in the 5th and 6th centuries AD in eastern England operated as technologies of remembrance. Cremation encouraged distinctive forms of engagement with the physicality and materiality of the dead. It is argued that cremated bodies and ashes need to be theorized as more than osteological data, artefacts or symbolic resources, but as holding material agency influencing the selective remembering and forgetting of the deceased's personhood.									31	0	0	3	0	31			1359-1835			WOS:000225270800003	
J	Thomas, N								The case of the misplaced ponchos - Speculations concerning the history of cloth in Polynesia								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	1			5	20					MAR 1999	1999	Research in material culture studies has demonstrated that novel things can be assimilated to existing categories. This approach has implied that indigenous cultures in particular typically employ conservative strategies, in the sense that their recontextualizations of material culture aim to preserve a prior order, rather than produce a new one. This paper emphasizes instead the use of objects to create novel and distinctive values and social orders. It proceeds through discussion of the Polynesian garments known as tiputa or ponchos, which were originally made primarily in Tahiti, but came to be widely distributed in western as well as eastern Polynesia, where their adoption was associated with conversion to Christianity.									29	0	0	7	1	31			1359-1835			WOS:000079136800001	
J	Jones, Sian								NEGOTIATING AUTHENTIC OBJECTS AND AUTHENTIC SELVES Beyond the Deconstruction of Authenticity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	2			181	203		10.1177/1359183510364074			JUN 2010	2010	Our understanding of authenticity in the material world is characterized by a problematic dichotomy between materialist and constructivist perspectives. Neither explains why people find the issue of authenticity so compelling, nor how it is experienced and negotiated in practice. There is strong evidence supporting the view that prevailing materialist approaches to authenticity are a product of the development of modernity in the West. The result has been an emphasis on entities and their origins and essences. However, when we look at how people experience and negotiate authenticity through objects, it is the networks of relationships between people, places and things that appear to be central, not the things in themselves. The author argues that these inalienable relationships between objects, people and places underpin the ineffable, almost magical, power of authenticity and explain why people employ it as a means of negotiating their place in a world characterized by displacement and fragmentation. She illustrates this by drawing on ethnographic research surrounding the Hilton of Cadboll cross-slab.									30	0	0	0	0	30			1359-1835			WOS:000279766400003	
J	Binkley, S								Kitsch as a repetitive system - A problem for the theory of taste hierarchy								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	2			131	152					JUL 2000	2000	In this article, an attempt will be made to elaborate a theory of kitsch that dispenses with the traditional hierarchical framework within which kitsch is often understood. Avoiding both the populist approach of cultural studies, and the elitist approach of mass culture theorists, an argument is made for a uniquely kitsch aesthetic that employs the thematics of repetition, imitation and emulation as a distinct aesthetic style. Breaking from traditional analyses of popular conventionality in the realm of taste which aligns taste habits with class identities (such as that offered by Pierre Bourdieu), it is argued instead that the repetitive quality of kitsch addresses a general problem of modernity, that of 'disembeddedness', or the undermining of personal horizons of social and cosmic security ja model drawn from Anthony Giddens). The basis of this argument is drawn from a reconstruction of traditional theories of kitsch, though illustrative cases are offered.									28	0	0	0	0	28			1359-1835			WOS:000088417900001	
J	Ger, G; Belk, RW								Accounting for materialism in four cultures								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	2			183	204					JUL 1999	1999	Accounts for materialism are examined based on qualitative research in Romania, Turkey, the USA, and Western Europe. Various spontaneously offered accounts reconcile the discrepancy between the belief that materialism is bad and materialistic consumption behavior and aspirations. These accounts include justifications - passionate connoisseurship, instrumentalism, and altruism - and excuses - the compelling external forces, the ways of the modern world, and deservingness. The differences in accounts can be understood culturally and historically. In negotiating the 'bad' material world with their own consumption worlds, informants draw from various ethics prevalent in their cultures to moralize their personal materialistic consumption. Our findings suggest ways in which materialism, moralized by local accounts, is able to grow globally in spite of its condemnation.									27	0	1	0	0	28			1359-1835			WOS:000081919400004	
J	Carrier, JG								Mind, gaze and engagement - Understanding the environment								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	1			5	23		10.1177/1359183503008001760			MAR 2003	2003	A range of works on people's understandings of their surroundings express a recurring assumption that, as societies become more urban and capitalist, people are decreasingly likely to engage in practical and material ways with their surroundings, and are consequently more likely to stand at a distance from those surroundings culturally. This assumption implies that practical engagement is the only form of engagement that leads people to meaningful and consequential relationships with their surroundings, that the alternative to such engagement is something like the tourist gaze or the flaneur. Using a study of some environmental activists, this article raises questions about this assumption.									26	0	0	2	0	27			1359-1835			WOS:000181720000001	
J	Fowler, C								Personhood and social relations in the British Neolithic with a study from the Isle of Man								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			137	163					JUL 2001	2001	Studies of collective or corporate burial in the British Neolithic have focused largely on ancestors, clans and lineages, or the production of a microcosm of reality. Social relations are often described as egalitarian, or egalitarianism is taken to be the ideological impetus for corporate burial, belying inequalities in life. Studies of individual burial focus more on concepts of individual power, autonomous agency, status and possession. In this contribution acts of depositing Neolithic bones are interpreted as citations of social relations. The possibilities for studying Neolithic social relations between different aspects of life (human, animal, object, place) are explored using theories developed to understand how persons - and their worlds - are produced through activity. Such activities are considered as struggles with different kinds of ideological regulatory fictions about personal identity and social relations. The study starts with a consideration of ethnographic approaches to personhood, reviews recent work on British Neolithic mortuary practices, and concludes with a case study from the Isle of Man.									27	0	0	1	0	27			1359-1835			WOS:000169836700002	
J	Geismar, H								What's in a price? An ethnography of tribal art at auction								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	1			25	47					MAR 2001	2001	Typically, the auction house salesroom has been conceived of as an exemplary market: a place in which ultimate price is fixed by persons at a particular moment. This perspective relies on a static a-historical view of an isolated marketplace. This study views the auction sale of tribal art as one part of a wider economic set, within which objects and persons interact to momentarily assign price (or not). It thereby expands the common anthropological use of the notion of a 'tournament' of value (Appadurai, 1986). A brief background to the history of the auction and of the tribal art market precedes an examination of the auction as a 'distributed object' (Gell, 1998): a series of events from catalogue and viewing, to the performance of sale. Within each of these situations, price is shown to be fixed by ambiguous and malleable processes of valuation over space and time.									24	0	1	2	0	25			1359-1835			WOS:000167925200002	
J	Sillar, B								The dead and the drying - Techniques for transforming people and things in the Andes								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	3			259	289		10.1177/135918359600100301			NOV 1996	1996	Many aspects of a culture's technology, such as techniques, tools or raw materials, are elaborated as metaphors or areas of meaning within the culture's ideology. The choice of raw materials and the techniques used to process them depend on the representation of these materials and techniques within society. Such 'technical representations' play an important role in the trajectory of social and technological change. Examples drawn from present-day pottery making in the South-Central Andes are compared to other subsistence activities in the area to show how techniques may be used in a wide range of different social contexts. This has imbued the techniques with culturally specific meanings, which affects the choice of contexts within which they are considered appropriate. It is suggested that the storage systems developed by the Inka were a reworking of the techniques used in the burial tradition that emerged in the preceding Late Intermediate Period. The previous context of death gave a meaning to the technique, a meaning that was utilized within the technique's new application for state storage.									21	0	1	1	4	25			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77400001

It is with this in mind that this article travels to the tropical island of Singapore where the assumption that the air surrounding people should generally be cooled has quietly become entrenched. Specifically we focus on the young people we find in this country and consider how the presence of air conditioning has become implicated in particular combinations of social practice and sensual expectation amongst this group. The conclusion we draw is that it is only by attending to the contextual interplay of bodies, clothing and immediate climate that we gain the fullest sense of the processes underwriting a much wider retreat into indoor social spaces where these elements could be usefully understood as the material culture of routine human encasement.									23	0	0	1	0	23			1359-1835			WOS:000260339700001	
J	Hill, Jude								The story of the amulet - Locating the enchantment of collections								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				12	1			65	87		10.1177/1359183507074562			MAR 2007	2007	This article traces the stories of a group of amulets and charms from the early 20th century that were gathered together from different locations in Britain by the folklorist Edward Lovett. Through the sale of these objects, Lovett fostered a close working relationship with staff at the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum. In the museum, the amulets and charms were displayed as 'scientific' specimens as part of an attempt to trace the 'history of medicine and mankind'. However, drawing on recent work reappraising the relationships between magic, authority and modernity, and, by recognizing the magical qualities of the objects involved, it is argued that these objects retained the potential to enchant, haunting the space of the museum and disrupting the narratives of evolution and progress presented in this context. A study of the amulets' lives beyond the locus of the museum also sheds light on the potential agency of such objects and the spatialities of magical materialities in an era of modernity.									23	0	0	1	0	23			1359-1835			WOS:000244936000004

They are palimpsests in which buildings, street layouts and monumental structures are interpreted and reinterpreted as changing expressions of relations of power. The urban landscape of the Cape of Good Hope started with the establishment of a Dutch East India Company outpost in 1652, was restructured by the British after 1795, and gave form to spatial segregation in the apartheid years. More recently, aspects of these historical landscapes have been reinvented as entertainment centres in the 'experiential economy'. Differing ways of understanding these mixes of physical form, identity and recollection either lead to closure - retrospective celebrations in the interests of dominant interests - or to challenge: 'countermemories' that look for contradictions and uncertainties, keeping open the discourse of identity and relations of power.

J	Basu, P								My own island home - The Orkney homecoming								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				9	1			27	42		10.1177/135918350401088			MAR 2004	2004	The notion of 'home' has become a powerful motif in the contemporary popular and academic project to (re)locate identity in a globalized world of movement. Home is, however, also materialized in 'homeland' and, as the discourse of 'diaspora' has been ever more widely appropriated by a diverse range of dispersed populations, so the phenomenon of diasporic 'home-coming' has burgeoned - journeys, that is, in which members of diasporic communities 'return' to lost homelands as heritage-tourists and pilgrims. This article provides an account of 'The Orkney Homecoming', a packaged event in which over 150 Canadians of Orcadian descent travelled to their ancestral islands off the north coast of Scotland. Drawing extensively on the comments of participants and organizers of the event, the author argues that, through its materiality, the Orkney heritage-landscape provides a fertile soil into which the Canadian homecomers can root their identities.

Our goal with this special issue is to draw attention to the tools, narratives, and settings that people need to exploit ephemerality not just as a social practice but as a material one. We argue that rather than always seeking to objectify things, people undo form to achieve their social effect through working amid an unbounded flow of materiality. Consuming, vanishing, sacrificing, and fashioning all work as techniques of interacting, processes that enhance communities not by committing them to fixed cultural property but by linking people as agents or channels of shared substances. Ephemeral practice, however, is not the negative of objectification, but rather a related set of actions that have special significance for intersubjective experience, negotiating relationships, and the pacing of human interaction.									21	0	0	0	1	22			1359-1835			WOS:000186783700002

It focuses in particular on the hijab (Muslim woman's headscarf), suggesting that its adoption by middle-class Muslim women is often a product, not so much of their cultural backgrounds as of the trans-cultural encounters they experience in a cosmopolitan urban environment. The article explores the transformative potential of hijab, demonstrating how its adoption not only acts as a moment of metamorphosis in the lives of wearers, but also has significant effects on the perceptions and actions of others. These themes of metamorphosis, visibility and agency are explored in relation to the complex conflicting resonance of hijab in the West, and how that resonance is constantly being reshaped both through contemporary political events and their media coverage as well as through the actions and campaigns of hijab wearers.									21	0	0	0	0	21			1359-1835			WOS:000248727400002

During this time, the main problem of style has been one of definition. Whether cultural evolutionist, processualist or constructivist, the problem of 'what is style' has remained problematic. This paper attempts to go beyond the quest for a definition of style to question the foundations of the categorization of the world into style and utility, and, through the work of others, challenge the dualist doctrine that constitutes our view of the material world and our relation to it.									21	0	0	1	0	21			1359-1835			WOS:A1997XJ42400002

Its complex roots and meanings are scrutinized with particular attention given to the pictorial and scenic aspects of landscape, which are here historicized in relation to processes of cultural modernization. Landscape's roots in territorially based community governed by customary law have never been wholly destroyed and an analysis of the evolution of landscapes in Southern California suggests that they are being recovered in certain respects in the context of hypermodernity.

Detailed research into the specificities of sea and land ownership in the region has revealed a more complex pattern than has previously been supposed to exist. It is nonetheless one that can be accommodated within previous models of estate ownership in Australia. In the article we seek to explain the pattern of ownership observed according to ontological (mythological), ecological and sociological factors. We argue that these factors are relatively autonomous and act as co-determiners of a system that is both flexible and structured. We argue that the Yolngu view that land/sea ownership is ancestrally determined is entirely congruent with evidence of the long-term stability of the system of relationships between groups over time, in particular given that the Yolngu perspective includes ancestrally sanctioned processes of succession. We show how, through the rhetoric of sea ownership and the metaphoric discourse in which relationships between different estate areas are embedded, the land/seascape serves as an underlying template for spiritual and social relationships which simultaneously underlie, and emerge through, social action.

J	Gregson, N; Crewe, L				French, Shaun/B-1155-2010				Performance and possession - Rethinking the act of purchase in the light of the car boot sale								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	2			241	263		10.1177/135918359700200205			JUL 1997	1997	This paper provides both an empirical account of the act of purchase within the car boot sale and an evaluation of the implications of these findings for theoretical debates on consumption. The paper begins by urging the need to rethink the act of purchase within consumption studies: whilst theoretical accounts have presumed much about the act of purchase, these same accounts are argued to exhibit serious deficiencies, some of which can be located in their assumption that the act of purchase (and consumption more generally) is confined to conventional retail environments. In contrast, car boot sale purchasing is shown to involve both separately and simultaneously theatricality and performance, unpredictability and the unexpected, skill, thrift and pleasure and desire. Furthermore, such characteristics are argued to exert considerable influence on the rituals of possession, personalization and re-enchantment that are shown to accompany much car boot sale purchasing. We conclude the paper by emphasizing the continued need for research on consumption to connect the act of purchase to what is done with/to particular items; by examining the implications of our findings for theoretical narratives of risk; and by posing a number of questions for research on the act of purchase in conventional retail environments.									20	0	0	1	0	20			1359-1835			WOS:A1997XJ42400005

Yet, when we acknowledge it, it becomes clear that all the physical things we handle have a degree of independence. Indeed, by exploring the ways in which this independence is intimately accommodated, a richer understanding of certain kinds of experience could follow. With this argument in mind, this article travels to some domestic gardens in north London to reconsider the human activities associated with the plants that are found there. In these sites it seems that amicable arrangements of entity only ever become possible through fully embracing the fact that those people involved own only one, amongst many, of the agencies in evidence there. In fact, whilst an idea of a successful gardener can connote an efficient exercise of power, I want to argue that the opposite is actually the case. My contention, therefore, is that, to fully find pleasure from plants, people must become enjoyably expert in understanding that any complete control is always unlikely, and this is a contention with some potentially important implications for current patterns of practice.									19	0	0	2	0	19			1359-1835			WOS:000242441800005

It begins from a perspective of mural painting as a socially constructed artefact, which is involved in dynamic interaction with the local environment. But while most work on this subject area has focused on the reasons why paintings are created in the first place and/or on the meanings of their symbolic content, the article analyses what happens when the murals are no longer of any social interest and explores a number of reasons for their transformation, removal and disappearance. It defines a framework of seven categories: retirement, redundancy, recycling, redevelopment, reclamation, remonstration and restoration that can be used to explore how and why mural paintings that have reached the end of their life are removed or replaced.									18	0	0	0	1	19			1359-1835			WOS:000227729700003

In an environment where men have limited access to money or material goods, food assumes immense value. It has important symbolic associations for inmates in terms of 'home' and 'identity' while particular foodstuffs can be reworked to be employed in diverse ways within prison gym cultures, drug cultures and so on. Thus because food is a meaningful and useful commodity within the prison it has important exchange value, being traded both in its own right but also as a currency to purchase other more precious commodities. This in turn means that it is a source of conflict between individuals and between groups of inmates within prisons. The article therefore concludes by focusing on the role of food in the complex negotiation of power relations between inmates and staff, and between individuals and groups of inmates.									18	0	1	2	0	19			1359-1835			WOS:000075080900001	
J	Woodward, I				Woodward, Ian/A-4908-2008				Domestic objects and the taste epiphany - A resource for consumption methodology								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			115	136					JUL 2001	2001	The presentation of an aesthetic identity involves the accomplishment of a coherent, plausible narrative which links one's choices to desired characteristics of the self. As symbolic evidence of a person's taste, material culture is a vital component of a successful narrative. Via case studies of pivotal household objects, this paper uses face-to-face interview data as a way of investigating processes of aesthetic choice. Household objects are interpreted as material elements imbricated in the presentation of a socially plausible and internally consistent aesthetic self. Narrative analysis, and the concept of the epiphany-object, are proposed as useful ways of accounting for tastes in domestic material culture. Methodological questions of truth-telling and authenticity in the face-to-face context are considered, and the sociological problem of taste is scrutinized in light of ideas about social accountability and textual identity.									17	0	0	0	1	18			1359-1835			WOS:000169836700001	
J	Veenis, M								Consumption in East Germany - The seduction and betrayal of things								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	1			79	112					MAR 1999	1999	In this article the author focuses upon the feelings and expectations that pertained to Western material objects in East Germany, both before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Before these things were actually there, most East Germans seemed to have high hopes with regard to a life surrounded by this material-consumptive abundance. But now that the East German material world is completely Westernized, most people express severe doubts and distinctly ambivalent feelings with regard to the material changes that have occured in their country. By analysing the history of (the ideology surrounding) material culture in East Germany, characterized by an enormous gap between attractive promises on the one hand and a harsh everyday reality on the other, Veenis asserts that the material world on the other side of the Wall seemed to be the ultimate realization of all those beautiful sounding socialist promises. Within a socialist ideology, material development was the most important anchorpoint for far-reaching promises, which - taken together - boiled down to the idea that in the wake of (material) growth, amelioration and success, it would eventually be possible to realize a completely harmonious state of being. And because of their beautiful appearance, the sense of harmony and prosperity, the wonderful fragrance, the shining colours and the deep gleam that exuded from them, Western consumer-goods were attractive in an almost irresistible sensuous-aesthetic way. By emphasizing the sensuous characteristics of objects, Veenis uses the East German situation to further extend Daniel Miller and Colin Campbell's ideas with regard to the present-day place and role of consumption and the power of attraction of things in general.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1359-1835			WOS:000079136800005	
J	Meskell, Lynn; Scheermeyer, Colette								Heritage as therapy - Set pieces from the new South Africa								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	2			153	173		10.1177/1359183508090899			JUL 2008	2008	Since the democratic dispensation in South Africa, heritage as a category has been necessarily framed by the specter of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, its place in wider society, the general underpinnings of amnesty, forgiveness and the desire to move forward as a nation. Human rights activism, truth commissions, and juridical proceedings are powerful mechanisms for dealing with historical trauma. More materially, South African cultural productions, including objects, memorials, museums, heritage sites and public spaces of commemoration provide another therapeutic arena. After 13 years of democracy, the material spaces of daily life provide a vantage point to examine how practices of remembering and forgetting pervade the public sphere and the world of things, and how traumatic embrace is configured to include (and exclude) certain constituencies as our case studies demonstrate. Spectacles of trauma and memory in the new South Africa are similarly shot through with other interventions including the pressures of state politics, development tactics and international tourism. Perhaps like never before, this 'state in search of a nation', has been under an international spotlight and has been held up as a beacon for other oppressive contexts and post-conflict states.									17	0	0	1	0	17			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000258031900003	
J	Ashikari, M								Cultivating Japanese whiteness - The 'Whitening' cosmetics boom and the Japanese identity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				10	1			73	91		10.1177/1359183505050095			MAR 2005	2005	This article examines the strong preference for light complexions observed among Japanese women. Since the late 1980s, consumption of 'whitening' cosmetics has remained at consistently high levels, and a 'white' complexion has been considered trendy and desirable in contemporary Japan. This social phenomenon should not be understood simply either as a reflection of admiration for the West, or as an expression of traditional values of female beauty in Japan. Rather, the skin tones of Japanese people are recognized and expressed as a dichotomy of 'white' and 'black', which is linked to a further dichotomy of 'us' and 'them'. Through this link, the white skin becomes a symbolic physical characteristic for identifying the Japanese people. Although the white skin can be interpreted in many different ways, both good and bad, in everyday life, other meanings are often subjugated to the white skin as a symbol of Japaneseness. This article argues that the meaning of a symbol is not simply produced or reproduced but represented and authorized through the body decoration in public.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1359-1835			WOS:000227729700004	
J	D'Alisera, J								I love Islam. Popular religious commodities, sites of inscription, and transnational Sierra Leonean identity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	1			91	110					MAR 2001	2001	This essay explores how and why Muslim Sierra Leoneans living and working in the Washington DC metropolitan area inscribe religious identity onto their work sites by means of a variety of Islamic commodities. These items, ranging from bumper stickers and decals to informational pamphlets and kosher hot dogs, are physical manifestations of experience, a means of situating individual and community in transnational space. Looking at how individuals use religious objects to make and maintain their worlds points to the act of display as a physical manifestation of experience. How such objects are utilized on, in, and around taxi cabs and food vending stands - my male and female informants' primary work sites - reveals the artistic creation of new sensitivities towards self and religion, highlighting the complexity of multiple gazes and responses in multi-cultural Muslim and broader non-Muslim spaces.									15	0	0	0	1	16			1359-1835			WOS:000167925200005	
J	McVeigh, B								Commodifying affection, authority and gender in the everyday objects of Japan								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	3			291	312		10.1177/135918359600100302			NOV 1996	1996	Cute objects are encountered everywhere in Japan: in advertising, company logos, everyday objects and pornography; and in government-sponsored public safety posters, baby faces, smiling children, tiny bunnies and beaming bears are used to inform, warn, advise, admonish and shape opinion. Cuteness communicates power relations and power play, effectively combining weakness, submissiveness and humility with influence, domination and control. It merges meekness, admiration and attachment with benevolence, tenderness and sympathy. This paper focuses on the gendered aspect of cute things: how they communicate messages about being the 'ideal' woman. The multivocality of cuteness is revealed by employing Turner's symbolic analysis and this paper discusses the meanings and cultural values that, embedded in all the varied objects of cuteness, constitute a socionormative commentary about how women should behave, especially vis-a-vis men. Examples are provided to show how cuteness, as a sentiment that has been objectified, commodified and commercialized, affords communicative potency.									16	0	0	1	0	16			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77400002	
J	Moshenska, Gabriel								A hard rain: Children's Shrapnel collections in the Second World War								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	1			107	125		10.1177/1359183507086221			MAR 2008	2008	Anti-aircraft shells exploding at high altitudes scattered shards of red-hot steel across the towns and cities of Britain during the Second World War. For many schoolchildren, collecting and trading this shrapnel became a popular social activity, often recalled today in oral history interviews. Drawing on testimonies collected as part of the People's War project, this article examines these curious and neglected processes of accumulation, exchange and disposal, looking at the aesthetic qualities that gave shrapnel fragments their value and attractiveness. In doing so, it attempts to locate children's shrapnel collections within their social worlds, as well as within broader discussions of material culture and modern conflict. It highlights the significant differences from other more typical forms of collecting, and some of the more subversive uses that children found for their shrapnel. The article also raises the possibility that collecting these violent objects may have been a way for children to cope with the upheaval and brutality of total war.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:000254928100006

Conducting an analytic account of this conflict, it will be suggested that the images possess both a potent and multifaceted form of agency and are physically embodied by their patients; it will equally be implied that their efficacy is advanced through the explicitly performative nature of the graffiti act, the images' evident ephemerality and the specific character of their medium. Subsequently, through an investigation into the discourses of dirt and deceptiveness, the various rationales assumed for the images reviled nature will be discussed, and finally, utilising notions of appropriation and detournement, the particular nature of the graffiti-artists engagement with their environment will be examined.In concluding, the evident similarities between both graffiti-artists and graffiti-removers will be analyzed, and a personal account of the interaction with the images encountered will be attempted.									14	0	0	0	1	15			1359-1835			WOS:000254928100003	
J	Parrott, FR								'It's not forever' - The material culture of hope								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				10	3			245	262		10.1177/1359183505057151			NOV 2005	2005	This article explores the way patients in a medium secure psychiatric unit relate to the institution through the decoration of bedrooms and self-decoration through clothing and accessories. The ethnography reveals that a refusal to decorate can be contrasted with an extreme concentration upon clothing and style. These two material genres are compared in terms of the potential ease with which they lend themselves to different forms of objectification, the values, uses or discourses which are constituted and developed through these acts of objectification and the constraints on the ability of agents to express them. The evidence suggests that patients continue to conceive of themselves primarily in terms of another potential life outside the institution, attempting to 'live within' material cultures that orientate them towards the future and to external relationships.									15	0	0	1	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:000233337900002	
J	Norris, L								Shedding skins - The materiality of divestment in India								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				9	1			59	71		10.1177/135918350401805			MAR 2004	2004	This article calls for a reconsideration of the materiality of things in dynamic processes of self-making and personhood. Grounded in research in contemporary urban India, it is argued that it is in the act of divestment that the capacity for the recreation of the self is made most apparent, due to the intimate connection between clothing and the body. Cloth is also a vital element of gift-giving and the re-creation of social networks. The case study of a woman trying to get rid of an unwanted garment highlights the options available and the different regimes of value by which the worth of used clothing can be assessed. These include handing on treasured pieces to family members, recycling within the home, giving to servants, bartering them for new stainless steel pots or burning them for their silver and gold content. The sacrifice and destruction of such intimate objects are the necessary prerequisite for the renewal of self within a network of mutually constitutive person-object relations.

J	Tilley, C; Hamilton, S; Harrison, S; Anderson, E								Nature, culture, clitter - Distinguishing between cultural and geomorphological landscapes; The case of hilltop tors in south-west England								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	2			197	224					JUL 2000	2000	This article addresses the problem of how to distinguish between natural and humanly modified features of the cultural landscape with reference to clitter (boulder and stone) masses in the south-west of England using the example of Leskernick hill, Bodmin Moor with its well-preserved Bronze Age settlement. We first set out a series of criteria for distinguishing between natural and humanly placed stones on the basis of a series of formal geomorphological criteria. We then discuss the stones from an archaeological perspective setting out a series of archaeological criteria by means of which we can recognize the presence of humanly modified stones. From this basis we discuss four examples in detail. Finally we attempt to interpret the significance of the cultural modification of stone masses, previously regarded by both archaeologists and geomorphologists as being entirely natural in origin, by challenging the very culture/nature distinction for ascribing meaning on which the previous considerations are made. Whilst acknowledging that the distinction between a stone that has been moved by human agency, and one that has not, is important for interpretation this does not make it more or less culturally significant.									15	0	0	1	1	15			1359-1835			WOS:000088417900004	
J	Foster, RJ								The commercial construction of 'new nations'								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	3			263	282					NOV 1999	1999	This article considers the instrumental role of commodity marketing and mass consumption in producing nationality as a dimension of personal and collective identities. It asks: if nation-ness and nationality no longer necessarily refer to political identities, then to what sort of imagined communities, if any, do they refer? It addresses this question in part through a discussion of commercial images from Papua New Guinea, one of the 'new nations' of the South Pacific.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200002

The implications of this phenomenon are examined with respect to three types of texts: books, letters, and documents. As physical objects, books and letters have served as embodiments of experience and of the 'personal touch'. It is harder to give up documents as physical objects than books or letters. Not only the meanings inscribed in documents, but also aesthetic attributes of them and of the situations in which they are manipulated have been critical to the constitution of new social arrangements and relationships. As we move from late print culture to early computer culture, we will come to give up embodying functions of books and letters, which will become increasingly digital. Binding constitutive ceremonies may someday take place in virtual 'places' in cyberspace, with either virtual simulation of aesthetic experience, or with simultaneous real-world aesthetic activity among persons dispersed around the globe.									15	0	0	2	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:A1997WT04700001

This paper looks at the changing ways in which the world of goods has been a research topic. Drawing on the Swedish experience it also discusses some ways of revitalizing the field, focusing on the materiality of everyday life, from the level of home-making to nation-building.									15	0		0	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:A1997WT04700005	
J	Hosler, D								Technical choices, social categories and meaning among the Andean potters of Las Animas								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	1			63	92		10.1177/135918359600100104			MAR 1996	1996	Las Animas is a northern Andean community where potters have been making copies of archaeological artefacts for the last 30 years. Dual organization characterizes this village. Here, potters live on one side of the community, comerciantes (distributors) on the other. Ethnotechnological studies show that two distinct production sequences are used for this pottery. Men in the high-status upper barrio use one, women and men in the lower-status barrio use the other. This new craft offers a vivid example of the dynamic role of technologies in shaping social forms and categories and the ways in which those forms and categories shape technological choices: here, gender and status distinctions are manifest through technical practices. Animenos link their work to that of the Antiguos, their prehistoric predecessors. These beliefs may partly explain why pottery production has become a powerful vehicle for social expression.									15	0		0	0	15			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77200003

It looks at Nazi ideas about architecture and the agency of buildings as 'words in stone' and the Nazi intention that the built heritage would endure and continue to 'speak' over time. It then goes on to discuss some of the post-war struggle with the Nazi heritage (and more specifically the Zeppelin Building) and the ways in which agency has been variously attributed. This highlights contests and changes in the attribution of agency, and shows how such attributions are embedded in wider understandings and politics of identity (including processes of 'de-Nazification' and 'facing the past'), as well as being coshaped by the connotations and 'suggestiveness' of material forms.

In this article, we explore ways in which 'sacred sites' - both the term and the sites - are negotiated by different interest groups, fore-grounding our locations, as an archaeologist/art historian (Wallis) and anthropologist (Blain), and active pagan engagers with sites. Examples of pagan actions at such sites, including at Avebury and Stonehenge, demonstrate not only that their engagements with sacred sites are diverse and that identities - such as that of 'new indigenes' - arising there from are complex, but also that heritage management has not entirely neglected the issues. In addition to managed open access solstice celebrations at Stonehenge, a climate of inclusivity and multivocality has resulted in fruitful negotiations at the Rollright Stones.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1359-1835			WOS:000225270800002

The identity of photography as a medium and its phenomenological status is, from the outset, assumed as given. There is no concern for what photography actually is in different cultural contexts. Recognizing photographs as material culture is a way to address this blind spot, and suggests that any methodological use of them requires a more complex and subtle approach.

Often relegated to the role of witness most individuals passively watch the large-scale transformation of their built environment. The situation can, however, be totally different with fragments of buildings. In two cases, the demolition of the Berlin Wall and the deserted national-socialist seaside resort of Prora (Germany), alienating associations and large-scale phenomena are concretized and individualized through active personal handling. The circulation of architectural remains from one owner to another is charged with meaning; stories told about these objects are a means to give sense to a more complex history and the ruins themselves function as valuable intermediaries between history and individual experience. The social life of architecture does not always end with its destruction, quite the contrary. Slashed into pieces, recycled, transformed, it continues to live in fragmented form.									12	0	0	0	2	14			1359-1835			WOS:000184232100004

While agreeing with Bourdieu's contention that spatial meanings are invoked through the practice of men and women, I argue that the embodiment of socio-spatial divisions is contingent upon both gender and non-gender-based principles such as age and status affiliation. I suggest, furthermore, that the space of the house is never unambiguously private or public. Boundaries between these domains cannot be meaningfully drawn because they. constantly shift in accordance with the categories of actors who inhabit space. The moral codes governing behaviour and the practical activities of men and women produce continuities and discontinuities in the ordering of space both inside and outside the house.									14	0		0	0	14			1359-1835			WOS:A1997XJ42400001

J	Saunders, NJ								Bodies of metal, shells of memory - 'Trench Art', and the great war re-cycled								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	1			43	67					MAR 2000	2000	'Trench Art' is the evocative but misleading term used to describe a wide variety of objects in various media made by soldiers, prisoners of war, and civilians during the First World War (1914-18) and the succeeding inter-war period (1919-39). The production of such objects appears as a widespread human response to the conditions of modern warfare, with examples coming from the Beer War and many if not most 20th century conflicts. This essay focuses on metal 'Trench Art' from the Western Front between 1914 and 1939. It offers an initial categorization of types, and explores their various symbolic dimensions as souvenirs and mementoes, objectifications of loss, war trophies, and as materializations of the relationships between object and maker, men and women, the warring nations, and the living and the dead. It is suggested that 'Trench Art' is an important and hitherto overlooked source for understanding the cultural memory of 20th century war.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1359-1835			WOS:000085507100003	
J	Jaffe, A								Packaged sentiments - The social meanings of greeting cards								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	2			115	141					JUL 1999	1999	This paper analyzes the social uses and meanings of greeting cards. It argues that cards occupy an intermediate and shifting place in between the opposing social categories of 'gift' vs. 'commodity'. The fact that the card is not a pure gift is the source of social criticisms of cards as impersonal. But the card's ambiguous status is also at the heart of its unique communicative potential. Analysis of specific cards and card categories shows how card senders can exploit various and multiple dimensions of the card's gift and commodity-like qualities to express socially authenticated identities and sentiments, as well as to send subtle and complex new messages about identities and relationships. Card use also shows how commodities can be 'appropriated' as gifts in the act of shopping and choosing; moreover, the consumption of cards is depicted as a dynamic site of 'virtual' interactions between sender and receiver. The specific case of greeting cards is used to illustrate the more general point that most things are not intrinsically 'gifts' or 'commodities'. Rather, things acquire these identities by virtue of social interactions and processes.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1359-1835			WOS:000081919400001

Although the state created obstructions to emigration, it was viable for women with family overseas to travel to the West as visitors, sometimes turning temporary stays into permanent settlements through marriage. For others, westward travel was made possible by professional employment opportunities. These journeys of migration not only crossed political divides, but also forced a fundamental shift in the material lives of the migrants, transporting them from a shortage economy supported by black market activities to a relatively affluent consumer society. Based on in-depth interviews, this article considers three aspects of the telling of this change in these women's material lives: how they related their material experiences of socialist Poland; how they framed their encounters with their new consumer environment; and how they reconfigured their material relationships with those left behind.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000254928100004

After discussing in general terms the life of 'saint' stones (ota) in Candomble, this article then focuses on the traces of the life history of one of these ota. This stone was seized in a police raid in a Candomble house, and then displayed in a museum, until a legal action recently undertaken by political activists obliged the museum to withdraw the stone from exhibition. In the conclusion, I propose to recognize notions of historicity and materiality as keys to understanding the life and 'agency' of this and other objects.									9	0	0	0	3	12			1359-1835			WOS:000230513100003

I reflect on discourses that value objects, identity heritage, and customs in a package, which make cultural groups look like individuals to whom certain rights are attached. I do so in the light of material drawn from fieldwork on the Rai Coast of Papua New Guinea. There too, people place a high value on what they term kastom; a word in Neo-Melanesian which derives from the English term 'customs' but has a rather different meaning. I suggest that Nekgini speakers' valuation and validation of 'kastom' contrasts sharply with notions of value built into heritage and cultural property. There is a particular conception of integrity and continuity a relevance based on the needs of the state or individual identity which is embedded in the notion of cultural property. I contend that this conception obscures the creativity which Nekgini speakers value in the practices of 'kastom'. My wider point is to question the direction in which recommendations covering the protection of cultural property has led.									12	0		0	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000184232100001	
J	Halstead, N								Branding 'perfection' - Foreign as self; Self as 'foreign-foreign'								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	3			273	293					NOV 2002	2002	This article examines notions of fake and real vis-a-vis East Indians' interactions with American brand names, which provide particular insights into how they define themselves in relation to the 'foreign'. It considers how this claiming of the foreign allows for a notion of personhood which relies on outward migration or how people imagine themselves as being somewhere else. Belonging has to be understood in relation to another place, the locus of which in contemporary Caribbean has come to mean North America. It is how the American brand explicates an idea of perfection that in turn illustrates how East Indians in Guyana and New York relate with the foreign as self and the self as other to complete a sense of who they are. The notion of the fake indexes these relations in terms of both 'real brands' and 'real lives', which find different meanings in the shifting landscape of the foreign.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000179758900002	
J	Landzelius, KM								Charged artifacts and the detonation of liminality - Teddy-bear diplomacy in the newborn incubator machine								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	3			323	344					NOV 2001	2001	This article employs ethnography to explore the multiple significations of ornamenting the incubator, a quasi-ritual practice wherein mothers of preterm babies place rudimentary things, like stuffed animal toys, into their infants' life-support machines. I contend that such enactments pose more or less conscious endeavors to domesticate and animate these prosthetic devices, as veritable cyborg wombs which interpolate mother-child bonding and problematize maternal identity. In these acts, the 'technoscapes' (Appadurai, 1990) of cheap, mundane items and exclusive, precision instruments converge in a paradoxical, but fertile juxtaposition to make the ambiguous figure of the preterm infant culturally-intelligible as well as biologically-viable. It is suggested that the liminality of toys and trinkets out of place empowers them to attenuate the alienness of the incubator and its techno-liminal capacity to alienate. A kind of teddy-bear diplomacy is in play wherein juvenile playthings are enlisted to detonate the charged foreignness of the incubator-other, and bring baby into familiar cultural grammars.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000172578600003	
J	Meintjes, H								'Washing machines make lazy women' - Domestic appliances and the negotiation of women's propriety in Soweto								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	3			345	363					NOV 2001	2001	This article explores the multiple symbolic associations of two domestic appliances - the washing machine and the coal stove - in a neighbourhood in Soweto, South Africa, and examines the ways in which these appliances as symbolic objects are integral in the construction and negotiation of women's 'proper' roles and relations. The (in some cases incoherent) multivalence of the appliances sets them up as ideal sites for contestation over the definition of desirable gender roles and identity. An examination of people's attitudes towards, and actions around, these two appliances is thus revealing of their own notions of gender propriety.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000172578600004	
J	McVeigh, BJ								How hello kitty commodifies the cute, cool, and camp - 'Consumutopia' versus 'control' in Japan								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	2			225	245					JUL 2000	2000	Asked about Hello Kitty, respondents judged those interested in this 'character good' within a framework of freedom/self-autonomy versus coercion/compulsion. The former is associated with what may be termed 'consumutopia' (a counter-presence to mundane reality fueled by late capitalism, pop culture industry, consumerism), while the latter is connected to 'control', a critical view of self/collective relations that also comments on Japanese ethno-identity. Hello Kitty also demonstrates the need to focus not just on different tastes within a society, but also on ambiguous and diverse attitudes within the same individual. Such diversity allows Sanrio, Hello Kitty's maker, to link within one individual different modes of self-presentation, chronologically corresponding to girlhood ('cute'), female adolescence ('cool'), and womanhood ('camp'). Thus, as people mature, appeals to nostalgia encourage a reconnection with the past by buying products united by one leitmotif; same commodity, same individual, different ages/tastes/styles/desires.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1359-1835			WOS:000088417900005	
J	Rice, Tom								'The hallmark of a doctor': the stethoscope and the making of medical identity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	3			287	301		10.1177/1359183510373985			SEP 2010	2010	The stethoscope, and its use in the medical examination, has become iconic of 'doctors' and their work. Drawing on fieldwork in a London hospital, this article explores why this is so. It argues that the application of this instrument in a clinical situation allows for a particularly neat enactment of key 'dispositions' of what might be described as a doctor 'habitus' (Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice, 1980). Examining the politics of stethoscope ownership and display, the article also reveals some of the capacities or types of 'agency' doctors assign to the instrument that they exploit in the day-to-day production and performance of their medical identity (Gell, Art and Agency in Anthropological Theory, 1998). At a time when new diagnostic technologies threaten to render the stethoscope obsolete, doctors are shown to want to retain the instrument as a symbol of the skill and knowledge they possess, but which they believe to be increasingly devalued and undermined in modern medicine.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:000281678800002

Encounters with this monument have generated multitudinous materialities: hegemonic, conflicting and ambiguous. These trajectories have their own material circulations in both solid and narrative forms. Here, we consider materiality through the cultures inspired by/of the Wall. Through the formulation of an interdisciplinary methodology and praxis, we contribute to landscape studies generally and Romano-British frontier studies in particular. Firstly, we consider the genealogies of thought through which the Wall has been created, including its definition as a contested border and its use to inform discourses of nation and empire. Secondly, the material landscapes of the Wall are considered through phenomenon and encounter informed by contemporary debates in anthropology, archaeology and cultural geography. As part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Tales of the Frontier project (http://www.dur.ac.uk/roman.centre/hadrianswall/), the authors aim to provide an enriched account of the materialities of the Wall beyond traditional narratives generated by fieldwork and ancient historical texts.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:000275846300005

Museum collections are generated through complicated, fluctuating circulations of people and things that are literally endless and, when there is a high standard of computerized documentation, network analysis can be a stimulating and revealing methodological tool. Network analysis can reveal patterns in sets of social relationships that are too large to process or analyse mentally, and it can be a spur to more in-depth, nuanced research. An introduction to network theory and a consideration of 'network' as a metaphor for social and material interactions more broadly is followed by a discussion of our research into the history of the Pitt Rivers Museum and an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of network analysis as a research tool in the museum context.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:000251394200001

Motor vehicles have mediated much of humanity's experience of the world over the past century. Kuninjku people's interaction with motor vehicles, we argue, provides one revealing lens through which to explore a distinctive and ambiguous experience of modernity. This article explores the role vehicles play in mediating Kuninjku interaction across diverse arenas - their customary lands, an expanding regional social universe occupied by kin, the Australian nation-state, and finally an increasingly globalized world. Briefly exploring the process by which vehicles were introduced into Kuninjku country, we then track key transformations in Kuninjku life through a series of historical phases. The distinctive Kuninjku values that govern use of vehicles are explored. In conclusion the article reflects on the paradoxical nature of Kuninjku experience of late modernity and the fragility of their apparent success in realizing their aspirations.

J	Goldstein-Gidoni, O								The making and marking of the 'Japanese' and the 'Western' in Japanese contemporary material culture								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	1			67	90					MAR 2001	2001	This article uses the analysis of sets of contemporary Japanese cultural materials in order to explore the dynamics of the significant process of making and marking of the 'Japanese' and the 'Western' in contemporary Japanese culture. Through the observation of material culture - mainly food and clothing - in its public presentational arenas, it aims at reaching a better understanding of the processes in which the foreign and the local interact in this so-called era of globalization. Both the 'Western' and the 'Japanese' are illustrated as cultural constructs. The distinction between them is not based on objective classification. Their cultural making and marking is described on the background of the formation of the modern Japanese culture and cultural identity.									11	0		0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:000167925200004	
J	Meyer, B								Christian mind and worldly matters - Religion and materiality in nineteenth-century Gold Coast								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	3			311	337		10.1177/135918359700200303			NOV 1997	1997	In anthropological studies of the impact of missions in the non-Western world, Protestant missions' alleged claim that material matters were just 'outward things' subordinate to 'inward faith' has eschewed closer examination. This paper investigates a 19th-century German Protestant mission's actual and alleged attitudes towards materiality under the conditions of colonialism among the Ewe, as well as the tensions arising between missionaries and African converts about the role of materiality in life in general and consumption in particular. Examining the role missionary materializations played in conversion processes and investigating tensions between missionaries and converts about the proper relationship between 'civilization' and 'salvation', the paper shows that so-called worldly matters mattered much more than Protestant missionary rhetorics were prepared to acknowledge. Missions played a crucial role not only in the 'development' of the colony but also in the making of modern consumers. Tensions between missionaries and Ewe converts reveal that actually Christian identity itself was to a large extent produced through the consumption of Western commodities.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:000073336000003	
J	Kuchler, S								Sacrificial economy and its objects - Rethinking colonial collecting in Oceania								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	1			39	60		10.1177/135918359700200102			MAR 1997	1997	This paper examines the deposition and destruction of ritual artefacts in Oceania and positions the act of riddance in the ritual economy of sacrifice. A popular alternative to object destruction involves the sale of the object as a way to render it absent, and turning it into intellectual and image-based property, while at the same time eliciting the possibility for unspecified returns within an exchange of which we have become a part quite unknowingly. Large ethnographic or archaeological collections of single cultural areas may thus not just reflect the degree of western interest in artefacts represented in such collections, but is symptomatic of ritual work which results in the fashioning of alienable objects, inalienable images and a form of property whose intellectual, generative and reproductive nature is known to have formed the basis for independence across the Pacific.									11	0		0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:A1997WT04700002

However, this paper argues that a coherent aesthetic sensibility rooted in positive attitudes to the material world exists in evangelical practices. It traces the ways in which sacred language and religious experience are believed to be objectified in the body, the physical environment and the mass media. Such means of objectification, often partially controlled by evangelical elites, are shown to aid the reflexive presentation of a unified, imagined community of believers on both a local and global level.									11	0		0	0	11			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77200005	
J	Meyer, Morgan								Placing and tracing absence: A material culture of the immaterial								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	1			103	110		10.1177/1359183511433259			MAR 2012	2012	This essay engages with recent work on an unusual, yet fascinating theme: absence. Two edited collections have recently been published that deal with the topic: An Anthropology of Absence: Materializations of Transcendence and Loss (Bille et al., 2010) and The Matter of Death: Space, Place and Materiality (Hockey et al., 2010). These books explore an almost counterintuitive aspect of absence: its material culture. Indeed, absence has a materiality and exists in - and has effects - on the spaces people inhabit and their daily practices and experiences. Drawing on the discussions in these two books and on other recent developments in the study of absence, this essay considers the relational ontology of absence, conceiving absence not as a thing in itself but as something that exists through relations that give absence matter. Absence, in this view, is something performed, textured and materialized through relations and processes, and via objects. We therefore need to trace absence. This entails following and describing the processes through which absence becomes matter and absence comes to matter. It means to map out, locate and follow the traces of absence and understand absences as traces, that is, as residual, incomplete, elusive, ambiguous, yet material entities.									9	0	0	0	1	10			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600006

AND SUBJECTS								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	4			459	470		10.1177/1359183509345944			DEC 2009	2009	Techniques are usually defined as efficacious actions on something, that is, typically, on material substances and artefacts. This definition may be extended to the techniques of the subject as efficacious actions on the embodied human being. Consequently, the relevance of the anthropology of techniques may be extended from the material world to the human subject. This article draws on the work of Hubert, Mauss, Foucault and others, and on an ethnographic example to suggest that the efficacy of the techniques of the subject may rest on a process of identification between subjects and objects.

Museum collections are inducted into this hyper-complex world and wider debates in public culture through Google-enabled initiatives and links to YouTube, Flickr and MySpace. As museum culture and public culture reconnect through these various modalities, this poses new sets of challenges for museums, demonstrated by the different and increasingly complex exchanges and interactions observed around objects. Collection documentation systems, however, still tend to produce a certain and stable material world with clearly defined cultural categorizations. This article explores theories of hyper-complexity and transdisciplinarity developed as part of the Australian Research Council Project's Reconceptualising Heritage Collections. It reframes ways of understanding the relations and organization surrounding museum objects in today's hyper-complex, non-linear world. Moreover, it offers a conceptual framework for re-imagining collections' interpretative and management practices as they might operate as complex systems in these new political spaces.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1359-1835			WOS:000266373900003

Contending that materialization is contingent upon but not reducible to the materials used, an attempt is made to understand the implications of using different materials to represent humans, especially clay and stone. Thus, it is suggested that in the earlier Neolithic, clay and stone were reserved for different classes of artefacts. Human figures in this period show an interest in action, whereas in the later Neolithic, changes occur that suggest a preoccupation with the substance of the figures. It is suggested that these changes point to the emergence of different subjectivities during the later Neolithic.									10	0		0	0	10			1359-1835			WOS:000260339700004

This article reveals the sensual, intimate life of Manggarai sarongs as everyday garments, a life that has remained a 'secret' in the academic literature. Sarongs, with their capacities to wrap, protect and hide, accentuate the properties of skin and can therefore be considered 'super-skins'. As artefactual extensions of their wearer's body they absorb substances and intentions, offer comfort at times of upset or illness, and transmit social and emotional messages. As burial objects, sarongs index the close kinship performed, in everyday acts of feeding, comforting and protecting. However, there is no single 'social life' or 'career' of a sarong. Instead, sarongs as super-skins have a range of possibilities of becoming, in connection with the varied fates and projects of human lives.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1359-1835			WOS:000244936000002

It argues that those approaches owe much to ways of seeing, which have their roots in the Romantic tradition, in particular, a tendency to privilege vision over the other senses. The more recent history of the area is drawn upon to argue for approaches which deal more directly with the physical engagement with landscape at varied scales. Such an approach has implications for the ways that the area has been, and remains, caught up in discourses of identity.

In analyzing the origins, popularity, and disuse of one pigment (that is, Indian yellow) that had particular relevance for painting Indian subjects, I look at the intersection of material culture and imperial politics. The process of visually representing Britain's colonized subjects of the Raj was, I argue, implicated in a complex set of ideas about indigenous labor and religion that ultimately necessitated a ban on or disuse of Indian yellow in the metropole.

The issues hinge on people's agency to make object return address wider efforts toward self-determination, remembrance, and political redress. Despite important historical, social, and structural differences, these two situations display some startling similarities. I focus here on the discursive construction of the issues - attending to the language of claims for return - as a means of interrogating the term 'cultural property' and highlighting some strategies involved in its deployment. I also suggest ways in which the cultural frame of 'art' adds significant value to the objects in question, while deflecting attention from some political and economic factors involved in their (e)valuation.					101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 20-24, 2002NOV 20-24, 2002	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA	10	0	0	0	0	10			1359-1835			WOS:000222829500002

This article argues that some recreational activity is realized through interaction with material objects and uses the example of windsurfing to show how. Three approaches to understanding the sociological features of the human-object interaction are considered. The first looks at playing as a distinctive type of social activity; how playing with a windsurfer involves 'ilinx' type play (Caillois, 1961) and how it may lead to 'play-excitement' (Elias and Dunning, 1986). The second argues that consumption, through the exchange of value and signs in a variety of discourses, socially locates the play activity of windsurfing. The third approach looks at the way that the user interacts (Mead, 1962; 1980) with the objects of the windsurfer to engage in play.These three approaches together show that playing with things like wind-surfers provides a particular type of emotional outlet, situates the sailor in particular social contexts and shapes particular lines of action, including imaginative and discursive action.

J	Veber, H								External inducement and non-westernization in the uses of the Asheninka cushma								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	2			155	182		10.1177/135918359600100202			JUL 1996	1996	The cushma is a cotton tunic worn by the Pajonal Asheninka and other montana Indians in the Peruvian Amazon. The cushma constitutes an important article of dress and cultural identity. Its continued use points to the persistence of shared Asheninka values and practices in the face of prolonged colonization efforts in the area. An influx of industrial goods into the Asheninka trading system has boosted the circulation of traditional exchange items. Recent political organizing has further strengthened Asheninka identity. Asheninka leaders who have started to wear Western-style clothes now don the cushma to display Asheninka-ness to influential outsiders. No longer may we assume that its use merely testifies to the cultural purity of its wearer. Its use may also be an indication of his or her sophisticated acknowledgment that the timely display of indigenous identity may well be rewarded. This adds a new layer of meaning to the Asheninka cushma.									10	0	0	1	1	10			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77300002	
J	Born, Georgina								Music and the materialization of identities								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	4	SI		376	388		10.1177/1359183511424196			DEC 2011	2011	How does music materialize identities? This article argues that music is instructive in conceptualizing the materialization of identity because it opens up new perspectives on issues of materiality, mediation and affect. These perspectives are intimately related in turn to music's plural socialities, which necessitate a novel approach to theorizing the social. Music, it is proposed, demands an analytics that encompasses four planes of social mediation; while these socialities, with other forms of music's mediation, together produce a constellation of mediations - an assemblage. All four planes of social mediation enter into the musical assemblage: the first two amount to socialities engendered by musical practice and experience; the last two amount to social and institutional conditions that afford certain kinds of musical practice. The four are irreducible to one another and are articulated in contingent ways through relations of synergy, affordance, conditioning or causality. By adopting the topological metaphor of the plane to stand for distinctive socialities mediated by music, the intention is to highlight both their autonomy and their mutual interference. The second half turns to genre theory to suggest that analysing genre in terms of the mutual mediation between two self-organizing historical entities illuminates both how social identity formations may be refracted in music, and how musical genres can entangle themselves in evolving social formations. Finally, with reference to music's capacity to create aggregations of the affected, the article considers the efflorescence of theories of affect, association and entrainment. While such theories illuminate the generative nature of the mutual mediation between musical formations and social formations, they are limited by lack of awareness of the four distinctive planes of music's social mediation, as well as the significance of their autonomy and their contingent interrelations for understanding how music materializes identities.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000304883200003

While the literature on iconic or 'symbolically dense' brands primarily focuses on shared meanings and ideas that iconic goods come to stand for, we argue that a material perspective provides a richer and more nuanced understanding of this consecration process. Accordingly, we consider the manifold material forms and practices through which the iconic status of some Soviet goods is constituted and identify (perceived) material constancy, monumentalization and legal codification as three main realms through which the transcendent socio-cultural values of these brands are contested and established. We take the story of a monument to a brand as a challenge to bringing the notion of materiality into a more explicit and dynamic relationship with signification, thus moving from the separation of the two notions. Such a move, we suggest, helps elaborate the role of iconic consumer goods in re-constructing social bonds, community identities and ideology.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1359-1835			WOS:000279766400004

It examines the implicit meanings objectified in the materiality of, and the daily praxis associated with, rubbish that the Dogon select and allocate to particular places in and out of their 'home container'. These are framed within a recycled cosmology that encompasses a plurality of entangled world-views that inform us about the life cycles of people, environment and society.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1359-1835			WOS:000251394200005

Drawing on case studies from fieldwork in northern Botswana, this article argues that memory, or more especially processes of remembering, is importantly related to the spatial and temporal fluidity of the Tswana home and its inherent divisibility. The article argues that understandings of the house as a container for memory or biography have not sufficiently understood the way in which the materiality of the house, as well as its spatial configurations over time, are involved with the way in which such memories are formed and articulated. It also suggests that, in its connectedness to memory and community, building activity is an important material basis for cultural understandings of relatedness.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1359-1835			WOS:000248727400003

Differences between homes may be minimal, however the differentiation between homes, can occasionally, be marked (Wallman, 1978: 203). This observation has relevance for Norwegian and Somali households whereby perceptions of domestic boundaries, visibility and definitions of privacy are analysed. The domestic window is shown to provide one material medium for the negotiation of ethnic identity and social classification. I argue notions of the private are dynamic and contextual and frequently have less to do with 'being seen' than with a perception of the social gaze. Consequently, looking at ethnic minorities, Norwegian locals and the private home in Skien does not just imply investigating the link between visibility and privacy but questioning the ideas on which this link is based, and rethinking notions of privacy itself.									8	0	0	0	1	9			1359-1835			WOS:000230513100004

Competing visions, of art production as substitute for welfare, art as continuity with pre-modern crafts, art as Canadian national symbol, art as the expression of extreme alterity in the form of an animistic hunter-gatherer people's world view, brought into being a dynamic new set of creative forms which surpassed all of those views. In Gell's terms, these new art forms were means of carrying out the will of these competing persons in a complex competition to control social and cultural relationships. Yet this, in some sense, imposed aesthetic category of 'Eskimo Art' was in turn appropriated by the Inuit and transformed in both discourse and practice to express their active (rather than passive) relations with the Canadian state. Indeed by the 1970s the Inuit had come to believe that a major component of their identity in the world was that of artists, and they built on this new strength to establish new economic, social and political institutions. This case illustrates the complex way in which indigenous art can simultaneously proclaim difference or distinctiveness from the surrounding nation-state and also express that nation's identity within the world of nations. Objects, with their multivalent potentials, seem uniquely able to carry out such symbolic projects.					101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 20-24, 2002NOV 20-24, 2002	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA	8	0	0	0	1	9			1359-1835			WOS:000222829500003	
J	Harrison, R								'The magical virtue of these sharp things - Colonialism, mimesis and knapped bottle glass artefacts in Australia								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	3			311	336		10.1177/13591835030083007			NOV 2003	2003	Items of transformed material culture, in particular knapped bottle glass artefacts, have formed a focus for the archaeology of Aboriginal-settler contact in Australia. This article considers the idea of glass artefacts as skeuomorphs through the lens of Gell's and Taussig's writings regarding mimesis and the construction of 'Other'-ness in colonial relations. As in the case of Benjamin's discussion of the photographic reproduction of artworks as a phase in the struggle between photography and painting associated with modernity, so in colonial contexts did the oscillations of mimesis and alterity begin to merge, so that the 'West' began to alter itself as viewed through the eyes of its 'Others', and Aboriginal people to mimic themselves as alters of the 'West'. It is in this strange oscillation of mimesis and alterity, within Taussig's 'nervous system' itself, that the meaning of knapped bottle glass artefacts can be found to lie. The continued manufacture of formal 'traditional' stone artefact types and the re-emergence of 'archaic' forms in glass represents on one level a humorous gesture which provides insights into the ways in which Aboriginal people understood colonialism in radically different terms to the colonial 'West'. On another level, it can be seen as a political and practical decision with implications for how we understand the agency of Aboriginal people in Australian colonial encounters.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1359-1835			WOS:000186783700007

The sacrificial process converted the body into a sacred object and imbued it with meaning. The second transformation - dismemberment - partitioned the cathected body into ritually efficacious body parts suitable for use as offerings to the supernatural. In contrast to classic perspectives on sacrifice, which focus on the act of immolation, I expand this perspective to include post-sacrifice transformations, including dismemberment, consumption, and distribution.

Reflecting upon the 'embedding' of style within the distant past (i.e, the 'project of origins'), these tell of the changing configuration of the nation's cultural landscape and provide further insight into the role of ruination in the architect's work. Two out of the three images considered have 'fantastic' attributes and raise issues relating to the interaction of monuments and follies. Others have a direct relation with 3-dimensional model-based presentations, and the nature of the 'translation' of imagery between different media is also discussed.									9	0		0	0	9			1359-1835			WOS:000165460300005

By examining the ideological and affective meanings of a colonial funerary landscape like the Park Street cemetery in Calcutta, it shows how monuments of colonial memories have transformed into signs of temporal ruptures, which disturbs the dichotomy between the colonial and the post-colonial. It argues that the discard and abandonment of colonial cemeteries in the postcolonial landscape stems from the ambivalent meaning that such a heritage site generates. Using three pairs of conceptual constructs Kristeva's genotext and phenotext; Freud's melancholy and mourning; and tropological metaphor and metonymy - I demonstrate that this ambivalence is located in an intersection between the funerary monument as a cultural product of a colonial ideology, and as a memorial artifact of personal bereavement.					5th World Archaeology Conference5th World Archaeology Conference	JUN, 2003JUN, 2003		Washington, DCWashington, DC	8	0	0	1	0	8			1359-1835			WOS:000242441800004

I argue that verbal practices, generally overlooked in material culture studies, are an integral dimension of consumption. Types of talk - both referential and indexical - can illustrate how people mediate relationships with objects, as well as with each other. Drawing on ethnographic research in Silicon Valley, California (1999-2001), I present, examples from middle-class South Asian American communities. In these closely-knit social contexts, I examine how people discursively create objectifications through talk and consumption of visual media. such as video and photographs. My examination of these language practices reveals that people not only form relationships with objects they own, but also with objectifications - verbal and visual representations - of objects they borrow, rent, or imagine. Social theorists have remarked on how people can use contests of status and display associated with consumption to ascend into higher social classes. I consider how youth and adults engage in language use and consumption to instead display identity and status within their own community.					101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 20-24, 2002NOV 20-24, 2002	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA	8	0	0	1	0	8			1359-1835			WOS:000242441800002

Their circulation through public and private spaces is, however, subject to limitations, variously perceptible. The notion of figuration is used to consider the ways in which this material is apprehended. Non-natives through whose hands this material circulates, typically exercising what they think of as their rights to freedom of access, are led towards more intractable forms of 'evidence' for aboriginality. First Nations, equally implicated in its circulation, exercising their sovereign rights, monitor the 'trivia' in such a way that it becomes, not without an ironic readjustment of power relations, a line of defence against further encroachment. In this sense the most ephemeral, apparently valueless, items are characterized by keeping-while-giving and are declarations of the inalienable. It is suggested that inalienability derives from the idea of mutual embodiment as between humans and non-humans figured in the crests.					101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 20-24, 2002NOV 20-24, 2002	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA	8	0		0	0	8			1359-1835			WOS:000222829500005	
J	Eaton, N								Excess in the city?

It explores the critical entanglements of this art of mechanical reproduction within the cosmopolitics of imperialism. Questioning the 18th-century 'consumer revolution' and contemporary 'actor network theory', it asks whether either help us to comprehend fully these picture-human relations. In time of economic boom and recession within this early East India Company state, art was valued not so much as an inalienable possession but for its seemingly contradictory status as both quasi-fetish and as an aesthetic of the ephemeral. Patriotic yet disposable, such pictures participated within a visual labyrinth driven by lotteries and gambling, theft and debt. Using Indo-Muslim and British attitudes towards the colonial art market, this article exposes the centrality of chance and luxury for a creole heterotopia that ultimately hinged on a tense ambivalence.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1359-1835			WOS:000181720000003	
J	Lehtonen, TK; Pantzar, M								The ethos of thrift - The promotion of bank saving in Finland during the 1950s								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	2			211	231		10.1177/13583502007002640			JUL 2002	2002	This article examines the promotion and legitimization of bank saving in Finnish magazines during the 1950s. While trying to educate Finnish citizens to save, articles and advertisements ended up outlining a general model for the good life, structured by the ethos of thrift. At the household level, thrift meant a plurality of activities, not only passivity or restraint. The bank-saving discourse introduced new techniques of governing oneself and created possibilities for anticipatory pleasure: it oriented people towards commodities and simultaneously tried to tame consumer impulses. As an ascetic practice, bank saving was portrayed as not denying the material world; rather, its effect was to intensify the relation to the goods. Studying these texts and advertisements gives an enriched perception of economic actors who, with multiple techniques and skills, actively looked after their own welfare, as well as that of their families, local communities, and ultimately, of the nation.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1359-1835			WOS:000177429200005

Focusing on the traditional craft practices of stonemasons, the authors trace their relations to the broader nexus of experts responsible for conserving Glasgow Cathedral. They show that authenticity is a distributed property of distinct forms of expert practice as they intersect with one another and, crucially, with the material conditions of specific heritage sites. It is argued that, in the context of conservation practice, authenticity is neither a subjective, discursive construction nor a latent property of historic monuments waiting to be preserved. Rather it is a property that emerges through specific interactions between people and things.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000317865400001

In particular, they investigate war memorials as cultural objects and products of social discourses, but emphasize that the memorials are not reducible to these discourses. Rather, the materials used in the creation of war memorials as well as their holistic organization constitute vital aspects of the memorial site and its ability to engage individuals and groups in socially desirable and personally meaningful processes. The authors analyze the Massachusetts Vietnam Veterans Memorial, taking into account the holistic material organization, hyper-generalization of signs, symbolic functions, and social suggestions that the memorial provides for visitors passing through. They argue that, partially through its very materiality, the memorial guides the direction of viewers' affective response, leading to particular interpretations and reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000304882500005	
J	Fontein, Joost								Between tortured bodies and resurfacing bones: the politics of the dead in Zimbabwe								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	4			423	448		10.1177/1359183510383105			DEC 2010	2010	Bones occupy a complex place in Zimbabwe's postcolonial milieu. From ancestral bones rising again in the struggle for independence, and later land, to resurfacing bones of unsettled war dead or the troubling remains of gukurahundi victims, it is clear that bones are intertwined in postcolonial politics in ways that go far beyond, yet necessarily implicate, contests over memory, commemoration and the representation of the past. As both extensions of the dead (spirit 'subjects' making demands on the living) and as unconscious 'objects' or 'things' (retorting to and provoking responses from the living), bones in Zimbabwe not only challenge normalizing processes of state commemoration and heritage, but also animate a myriad of personal, kin, clan, class and political loyalties and struggles. Recent political violence indicates that it is not only dry bones but also the fleshy materiality of tortured bodies that are entangled in Zimbabwe's troubled postcolonial milieu. Therefore, the author seeks to explore and contrast the complexity of agencies entangled in the affective presence and emotive materiality of both bones and bodies in Zimbabwe. If bodies inscribed with torturous performances of sovereignty do have substantial, if duplicitous, political affects, how does this contrast with the unsettling presence of the longer dead? What does the passage of time - both the material and leaky decomposition of flesh, but equally the transformative processes of burial - do to the affective presence and emotive materiality of the dead? How do broken bodies become bones?									7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000208349300004

A contemporary conflict between residents, unknown artists and others is played out using banners, bottles, stickers, posters, stencils, spray paint and bodily substances. In this shadowy liminality, local and global debates are superimposed upon substructures constructed from disease, prostitution and the Saint of the Plague. The continuing urban struggle constitutes temporal statements of dirt and purity, violence and humour, dominance and resistance, death and salvation. Like the renovated facades masking the crumbling remains of structures long neglected, the local council's literal whitewashing of the art is a temporal cover-up of a discursive symptom stretching from deeply embedded preconditions. However, from his niche in the angular bend of the short side street bearing three names, the statue of St Rock remains unblinkingly staring, raised above the contestations expressed below him.									6	0	0	0	1	7			1359-1835			WOS:000260339700002

A localized monument, building, town, landscape or cultural tradition becomes globalized through the inclusion into the list of world heritage. Thus, it acquires a new status as being of 'outstanding universal value'. The aim of this global cultural policy as formulated by UNESCO is to enhance the pride of the local population in their own culture, foster efforts to its preservation as well as to enrich the whole of humanity in creating a cultural memory on a worldwide scale.					2nd European Conference on African Studies2nd European Conference on African Studies	20072007	AEGIS, African Studies CtrAEGIS, African Studies Ctr	Leiden, NETHERLANDSLeiden, NETHERLANDS	7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000258031900006

Here I follow the lead of anthropologists such as Levi-Strauss and Wagner and historians like Simon Schama. In particular, I highlight that what goes on 'inside' of myths is systematically connected to what occurs 'outside': how the intimate features of landscape form a kind of prism through which wider influences might be understood. The article considers two tidibe narratives from the Fuyuge people of highland Papua. These mythic narratives emerged at different moments in the colonial and post-colonial state project. Each narrative portrays features of landscape that simultaneously disclose a unique presence of time. This 'time' is different from the progress-orientated 'time' of government or missionaries. And yet, as I show, both are connected: through the ways government and missionaries transformed the Fuyuge people and their landscape, and how the Fuyuge landscape and tidibe came to reveal these 'outside' influences.

But their idea of what constituted 'traditional' design was itself new, forged first at international exhibitions and then in the context of Indian artisanal and consumer experimentation with novel combinations of foreign styles and objects. Indeed, it was the latter which prompted British art officials in India to call for a return to tradition. But traditionalism in design was not just in reaction to Indian cosmopolitan tendencies; it tried to achieve its own, slightly different cosmopolitanism by Indianizing western forms with the application of pure Indian ornament. I argue that it was in the intersection of these competing visions - Indian and British, metropolitan and colonial - of how to use and fill homes with new goods that a new definition of Indian traditional design emerged in this period.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000233337900003

Due to this fluidity, multiple and even contradictory race representations made their way onto trade cards. For example, in some tobacco tradesmen's cards, Africans were depicted as whimsical, carefree cherubs; in others they were ennobled as savage princes. While these conflicting depictions speak of the multiplicity of race views operating in the culture, they also demonstrate the uniform appropriation of the racial image in the service of commercial-colonial interests. Depending on the specific commercial advantage to be gained, a racialized trade image was constructed to affirm certain cultural values, such as participation in the colonial enterprise or adoption of western modes of civility. Collectively and from a cultural studies vantage point, these images embody the complexity of competing and colliding cultural discourses, from race and aesthetic theories to the colonialist agenda.									7	0		1	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000177429200002

In this article, the categories 'food' and 'textiles' are considered in the context of status-alteration systems in east Ambae, Vanuatu. An analysis of the women's status-alteration system huhuru, reveals a categorical association between certain textiles and ritual food, which undercuts the distinction between these two object types as essentially different.									7	0		0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000172578600001	
J	Ucko, P								Unprovenanced material culture and Freud's collection of antiquities								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	3			269	322					NOV 2001	2001	Over his long life Sigmund Freud collected at least 2500 antiquities, most of which are now on view to the public in the London Freud Museum. What has not previously been properly considered is to what degree Freud was archaeologically informed, and why he became involved in the 'excavation' of Duna-Pentele in modern Hungary. Much has been written (not least by psychoanalysts) on the possible symbolic significance both of his collecting and of what he collected. It is at least arguable that his purchasing of antiquities was more to do with his mood at any particular time, and what was available on the market, Over time, items in Freud's collection have been ascribed different significances by Freud himself, and by others. The changing nature of assessments of the significance of material culture should be kept in mind when confronted by some of today's politically correct stances.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000172578600002

This paper presents a critique of previous approaches to what is one of the best-known bodies of iconographic evidence in the archaeological literature, arguing that these interpretations fail to address the intimate, domestic context of the murals and mouldings. Instead they should be understood in terms of the routinized practices occurring within the same architectural spaces, which reflect their past interpretations and embodied experience. This mode of archaeological interpretation is developed in relation to the methodology adopted in new excavations at Catalhoyuk during 1995-7.									7	0		0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:000077074900005

However, anthropology has hardly taken notice of the visual representation of other cultures in recent contemporary art. In contrast with earlier modernist 'primitivism' these contemporary artists also appropriate anthropological methods and provide a critique of ethnographic and collecting practices. The article investigates the epistemological implications that arise from anthropological appropriations in contemporary art and ultimately argues that such art can be as legitimate in the representation of other cultures as already academically established written and visual discourses in anthropology.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77300003	
J	Rose, Mitch								Secular materialism: a critique of earthly theory								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	2			107	129		10.1177/1359183511401496			JUN 2011	2011	Over the last 20 years, studies of material culture have increasingly come to rely on the assumption that cultural and material forms are co-constitutive. Indeed, it is thought that the co-constitutive nature of culture and materiality guarantees the significance of materiality in the constitution of social relations. This article illustrates the limitations of the co-constitutive relation by characterizing it as overly secular. Specifically, it argues that the co-constitutive relation grounds the significance of material culture in a set of earthly dynamics that rob materiality of its privileged position. The article develops this position through two manoeuvres: (1) it describes a particular conception of absence as it is developed in current debates in continental theory; and (2) it demonstrates how a blindness to absence provides a limited understanding of the significance of material objects within social relations. In conclusion, the author argues that the recognition of absence re-orients the way we understand the significance of material objects by attuning us to how materiality marks that which is necessarily beyond the social.									5	0	0	0	1	6			1359-1835			WOS:000304882500001

In particular, it examines bones as relational entities, whose forms and material properties emerge through the interactions which take place with them. With reference to the author's own historical anthropological research on anatomy in Britain, discussed here in a wider European context, the epilogue explores the articulation of bones through metaphors and images, the relations between anatomical skeletons and memento mori and the assemblage of bones in ossuaries. It then discusses the interdependence of bones and embodied practices - the bones of the dead and the bodies of the living both mutually shaping one another - with reference to the articulation or making of skeletons by anatomists whose artisanal work with bones has not only generated knowledge but also entailed forceful emotional dynamics.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000208349300006

In responding to this question, we approach landscapes as assemblages of human and non-human elements that reach beyond the confines of their immediate physical and temporal locations. Our empirical focus is a small group of pine trees in a Tasmanian suburb, where remnants of human and non-human migration are inscribed and live on in the landscape and in human memory. We demonstrate how the trees simultaneously invite and resist purification through binaries such as nature and culture, wild and domestic, then and now. The histories and futures of belonging assembled in and through these trees are nothing less than active, idiosyncratic and ongoing processes of differentiation that shed light on the working out of postcolonial, globalizing societies and ecologies.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000279766400005	
J	Coupaye, Ludovic								WAYS OF ENCHANTING Chaines Operatoires and Yam Cultivation in Nyamikum Village, Maprik, Papua New Guinea								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	4			433	458		10.1177/1359183509345945			DEC 2009	2009	Yam cultivation and display are central and very contemporary concerns amongst the Abelam of Papua New Guinea. Long yams, especially, have been interpreted as phallic symbols, images of ancestors and valuables. Describing the processes from which these 'artefacts' emerge, gives some importance to local interpretations, i.e. the reasons rather than the causes driving local technical processes. This analysis of the notion of operational sequences, or chaines operatoires, proves very useful in unravelling the interlacing of practices and discourses that leads to the 'coming-into-being' of yams. Using a selection of operational sequences, the author discusses the methodology and investigates some aspects that have come out of his own use of the chaine operatoire. Through its potential for describing the relations actively created between long yam cultivation and other domains of experience, the chaine operatoire contributes to repositioning the study of techniques and technology in contemporary anthropological discussions of material culture.

It is argued at the outset that medieval archaeology has been very slow to consider the concept of resistance when interrogating the material culture of the peasantry and that items of dress are particularly amenable to such consideration given the close relationship between personal appearance and social power in this period. The dress accessories from seven excavated sites are investigated and interpreted as revealing the use of 'infra-political' power by members of the medieval peasantry as they deployed this aspect of their material lives in re-fashioning and resisting the identities imposed on them by the medieval elite.									6	0		0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000268332900002

Does it possess systemic characteristics that predispose its subversion from its intended purpose? The invention lineage of automatic weapons is considered in parallel with developments in the social organization of warfare. The AK is then evaluated in this context. In both technical and social terms, the use of the weapon by insurgents or in developing countries is not as remote from its intended function as would initially appear to be the case. Moreover, it is argued, the success of the AK is largely a result of the fact that it is a counter example to the prevailing episteme of technological progress.									6	0		0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000251394200004

In this article I argue that the introduction of Christianity to Rarotonga in the 1820s entailed the creation of two competing social fields, one materialized through churches and the other materialized through marae (ceremonial enclosures with god-houses in which were stored wrapped wooden poles, representing divine ancestors). The argument for regarding churches and marae as materializations of social relations is developed against Gell's analysis, in Art and Agency, of Maori meeting houses in which he proposes that we approach such structures as indexes of agency.									6	0		0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000244936000003

Tibetan carpets remain functional objects for their community of origin while they simultaneously advertise Tibetan culture internationally, support refugee institutions, and cater to the tastes of outside consumers. Foreign consumers exert conflicting pressures for artistic and technical change as well as for the preservation of 'traditional' production and motifs. The 'authenticity' of Tibetan carpets is thus called into question.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1359-1835			WOS:000073336000002

Solar-powered lights have become iconic objects of social entrepreneurship in Africa and Asia and this article explores the work involved in producing them as humanitarian goods. Following the 100th object from its conception in a Stanford University classroom to points of sale and use in rural India, the article explores how it has been made to materialise both an ethic of care and an ethic of commercial interest. Drawing from traditions in the social study of technology and the conceptual vocabulary of Michel Callon, the author argues that the significance of objects like the ultra-affordable solar lamp lies in their capacity to make and define markets at the bottom of the pyramid'.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000327547900003	
J	De Leon, Jason								Undocumented migration, use wear, and the materiality of habitual suffering in the Sonoran Desert								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				18	4			321	345		10.1177/1359183513496489			DEC 2013	2013	Since the late 1990s, unauthorized migrants attempting to cross the Sonoran Desert of Arizona have been relying on a unique set of material culture to evade Border Patrol, as well as prevent and treat injuries during the crossing process. Some media and academic attention has focused on the hundreds of migrants who die each year during desert border crossings, but little focus has been paid to the non-lethal injuries (e.g. blisters and dehydration) that hundreds of thousands of people sustain annually. Using a combination of ethnographic and archaeological data, the author argues that border-crossing artifacts both reflect and shape a way of being that is specific to the desert migration process. Expanding upon the archaeological concept of use wear, he demonstrates that modifications made to migrant goods provide evidence of border-crossing body techniques that are connected to widespread and routinized forms of corporeal suffering.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000327547900001

Meanwhile, the digital storytelling movement (involving the workshop-based production of short autobiographical videos) from its beginnings in the mid-1990s relied heavily on the narrative power of the personal photograph, often sourced from family albums and later from online archives. This article addresses the new issues arising for the politics of self-representation and personal photography in the era of social media, focusing particularly on the consequences of online image-sharing. It discusses in detail the practices of selection, curation, manipulation and editing of personal photographic images among a group of activist-oriented queer digital storytellers who have in common a stated desire to share their personal stories in pursuit of social change and whose stories often aim to address both intimate and antagonistic publics.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000323896500005

In the lives of archaeologists, however, soil too frequently plays the role of overburden, or the stuff holding the more important things, like stones and bones. At best, soil studies are seen as essential for environmental reconstruction or coming to grips with formation processes. A more grounded approach to interpreting agrarian life involves an understanding and appreciation of soil as a partner. In turn, thinking about soil opens new terrain in the study of landscape perception, ideology and memory. This article explores the potential offered by the materiality of sediments and soilscapes.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600002

Using an ethnographic study on wilderness guiding in Finnish Lapland, the article first examines the integral role of weather when conceptualizing tourist activities taking place outdoors. The authors identify three types of weather-related practices: anticipating and coping with the weather, as well as discursive practices related to weather. They therefore demonstrate how weather manipulates human practices by narrowing down or extending the possibilities for outdoor activities. Second, by materializing weather, the study provides a more nuanced understanding of the diverse ways in which weather a material entity in itself - is involved in the enactment of various socio-material practices; here the authors make the case for a specific repertoire of weather-wise skills. The study concludes that weather holds agency as it exerts a significant power in directing and redirecting human nature-based activities.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000304882700004	
J	Vilches, Flora								From nitrate town to internment camp: the cultural biography of Chacabuco, northern Chile								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	3			241	263		10.1177/1359183511412879			SEP 2011	2011	Chacabuco is one of the many abandoned nitrate or 'saltpeter' towns in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. The nitrate industry flourished from about 1880 to 1930, introducing a new system of production and social relations in the country. Founded in 1924, Chacabuco was active only until 1938, when synthetic nitrate developed by German chemists in the early 20th century began to dominate the industry. Unlike other nitrate ghost towns, Chacabuco later became an internment camp for a short period (1973-1974) during Pinochet's military dictatorship. Chacabuco's architecture of surveillance worked well for the military as they reused the nitrate workers' residential units as cells for political prisoners. This article examines this change of use as well as other issues of continuity and change between the two occupations of the town. The author also discusses the ways in which archaeology may offer parallel and complementary evidence to documentary and oral sources.									4	0	0	1	1	5			1359-1835			WOS:000304882700002

The author focuses on clothing as an instance of making in war. Specific attention is paid to the junction between the power to make (or unmake) and the social and ritual capacities for regulation through which making is governed. In this sense, the study is intended as a contribution to a revived interest in the incomplete Durkheimian project on elementary forms of technique, and techniques of the body in particular. The case-study material derives from the civil war in Sierra Leone (1991-2002) in which dress was as important an aspect of making war as weaponry. Various functions and social and material entailments of battle dress are described and differentiated, and the central role of magic for understanding clothing (and technology more generally) is underlined.

It sets out to challenge key anthropological debates about gifting that, firstly, focus on the inalienable connection between the donor and the gift and, secondly, emphasize the symbolic potential and historical depth of things. The Japanese gifts under discussion, employed in the production and reproduction of the social, cosmic and economic order, are commodities. They can be easily disentangled from the donor and are imbued with the spirit of the recipient through everyday consumption. Moreover, because these gifts are supposed to disappear through use, this article also draws attention to the significance of material loss in the creation of value.									5	0		0	0	5			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000268332900005

Above all, Herero-speaking Namibians have created various practices by which the war is commemorated annually. Seminal are commemorative rituals held in different areas of Namibia and organized by a ritual and social network established in the aftermath of the war. These commemorations provide a stage for the continuous reworking of the memory of defeat and flight, of dispersal, displacement and genocide, but also of survival and reorganization. The employment of uniforms in the commemorative practices of Herero-speaking Namibians is but one example for the way such memory work is also embodied in material culture. Historic as well as more recent developments of Herero memory culture are scrutinized in an appraisal of different images and representations of the past.					2nd European Conference on African Studies2nd European Conference on African Studies	20072007	AEGIS, African Studies CtrAEGIS, African Studies Ctr	Leiden, NETHERLANDSLeiden, NETHERLANDS	5	0		0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000258031900004

The early history of anthropology at Oxford University is explored with particular reference to Henry Balfour's work as curator of the Pitt Rivers Museum at the turn of the 20th century. Balfour and Gell both paid close attention to the formal qualities of things in an attempt to chart the linking threads of design and form which structure 'distributed objects'. Balfour was concerned with human origins, while Gell tracked shifting 'networks of transformational relationships' with no origin, but their methodologies show similarities because they both prioritized the physicality of things. Exploring the strengths and weaknesses of an earlier, scientific approach to people and things helps us to understand and reassess our own intellectual (and material) ancestry.									5	0		1	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000244936000005

An indexical analysis of prehistoric rock art and its relationship to monuments in the landscape of Kilmartin, Argyll, Scotland provides an enriched understanding of the relationships produced by marking the landscape.

This is achieved through the investigation of ships and the biography of their objects, identifying patterns of production and consumption. I concentrate on local scales looking at objects and the social relations they construct in Royal Navy ships and the different ways that identities are expressed and projected. I particularly focus on a case study: the pottery assemblage of sloop of war His Majesty's Ship (HMS) Swift (1763-1770) located in Puerto Deseado (Santa Cruz Province, Argentina). By utilizing the concept of praxis, this article goes beyond a descriptive analysis of wrecks by exploring them and their cargoes as embodiments of 18th-century social relations. More importantly, it will challenge traditional maritime approaches providing a different perspective that emphasizes the richness, diversity and complexity of British action at the end of the 18th century.									4	0	0	0	2	5			1359-1835			WOS:000233337900001

It focuses on how the experiential and situated aspects of everyday practice contribute to the case for treating trees as actants in social life rather than simply as a metaphoric resource. Material gathered at Hatfield Forest in Essex is used to examine how trees become entangled in the making of identity, and notions of time and place among wardens, volunteers and visitors. Trees are found to be both latent containers waiting for the correct intervention and active producers of meaning that structure human responses.

J	Colloredo-Mansfeld, R								Consuming - Andean televisions								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	3			273	284		10.1177/13591835030083003			NOV 2003	2003	This article follows consumers from Otavalo, Ecuador through narratives of devilish eating, jokes, and family gatherings in order to focus on a general problem: how a dispersed Andean indigenous people produce themselves as families, neighbors and community. In the episodes of consumption described here, consuming cultivates responsive relationships and using up and ingesting can act as generative moments for communities. However, the folktales and preoccupations of the transnational migrants reveal the risks that consuming entails. Human soulfulness - creativity, feeling, and morality - does not sit neatly within human agents, but rather can be augmented, diminished, or entirely dislodged in the consumption acts that join human and non-human; cultural and material. Even when consumption does augment a generative social agency, it also limits it. To consume is to stop one's movement through the world, converting the potential to matter to the reality of mattering in one place among a certain set of people.

The ephemeral and fleeting qualities are revealed in the social relations and interactions in which dress is embedded. Different contextual evaluations of the involvement of dress with their wearers' changing lives illustrate how demonstrative display of the dressed body produces experiences of dress that vanish almost as soon as they have been created.

J	Laviolette, P								Landscaping death - Resting places for Cornish identity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	2			215	240		10.1177/13591835030082005			JUL 2003	2003	This article explores the cultural construction of death and revival in Cornwall. In examining the ways in which these issues intertwine with the affirmation of local landscape identities, it surmises that an obscure and diffuse sense of 'deathliness' exists that generates collective and contested topographical memories and perceptions. By offering ethnographic interpretations of how people relate to contemporary burial places as well as a material culture analysis of prehistoric and derelict industrial environments, the article reveals three ways in which Cornishness rests in iconographical settings and material elegies. (1) from a prehistoric pedigree, where death and ancestry connect to expressions of folklore and custom; (2) through the ties that mortality has with the past's dangerous local industries; and (3) from the symbolic death brought about by the extensive emigrant diaspora or the dissipation of identity from tourism and immigration. These factors illustrate that enduring tangible aspects of identification are perpetuated by a partial relating back to dying-out ways of life. I thus propose that the prominence of death itself becomes a significant yet ambivalent material metaphor - a motif for shaping personhood and advocating solidarity.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000184232100005	
J	Yaneva, A								Chalk steps on the museum floor - The 'pulses' of objects in an art installation								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	2			169	188		10.1177/13591835030082003			JUL 2003	2003	This article argues against the well-established wisdom in sociology of art that a sudden artistic or institutional gesture can 'elevate' an ordinary object to the status of 'artwork'. Instead, it affirms that there is a gradual process of 'becoming art'. The mechanism of artistic activity does not consist of a single transformation of one huge difference into something artistically significant; it is rather related to the deployment of various small objective differences, their extension, intensification, repetition, and stabilization. It is the tempo of transformation that matters, but not the nature of these differences. Located in the objects, they are empirically describable. That is why the article follows ethnographically the process of installation of a chalk Bruegel copy on the floor of Musee d'art moderne de la ville de Paris in 1999 and depicts different sequences and rhythms of change in the materiality of all participants in an art installation.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000184232100003

We discuss the case of a failed tourist camp, constructed of brick 'yurts', which was built to exploit the exoticism of the Mongolian culture for the Han Chinese. This is an example of skeuopmorphic architecture, with deliberate slippage between the original and the copy, and we describe how this situation gives rise to various symbolic interpretations of the 'yurts'. It is argued that, despite certain similarities with post-modern vernaculars (e.g. Las Vegas), the political and ethnically confrontational situation in China means that the imitation 'yurts' do not in fact constitute a vernacular.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000177429200004	
J	Faure-Rouesnel, L								French anthropology and material culture								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			237	247					JUL 2001	2001	In this article, the author reviews three recent books that have been published on material culture in France. The main orientations of these books have to be understood by reference to French traditional anthropology and the interest in technology and traditional know how as well as to the analysis of Gift. They also illustrate new orientations such as the interest in the analysis of innovation process. The author finally compares the French context of material culture studies to the English context, explaining that the first one has traditionally focused on the study of production and circulation rather than consumption, even though French intellectuals such as Bourdieu and Baudrillard might be seen as having laid down the basis for material culture studies on consumption.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000169836700006	
J	Alexander, C								The factory - Fabricating the state								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	2			177	195					JUL 2000	2000	This article considers the Turkish State's use of the built environment to mould behaviour and how local practices modify such architectonic command sequences. Specifically, the Turkish Sugar Corporation from its inception to the present day is analysed, through the prism of the architecture of factory compounds. Through the fourfold structure of 'form', 'practice', 'building' and 'setting', the changing relationship between Republican centralist ideology and local practice is monitored. Local forms of architecture are analysed to suggest not only their practical appropriateness, but also as alternatives to the common equation of body and house.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000088417900003	
J	Lehtonen, TK								Any room for aesthetics? Shopping practices of heavily indebted consumers								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	3			243	262					NOV 1999	1999	This article describes the everyday practices of consumption of heavily indebted people and discusses the links between economic resources and everyday aesthetics. It is based on interviews with people in a Finnish debt adjustment programme. Becoming overindebted has markedly changed the interviewees' habits of consumption that are now characterized by constant and careful control of the resources and a self-understanding of never buying anything unnecessary. Becoming indebted has also affected the interviewees' relations to the social world: on the one hand they now feel themselves inferior compared to other consumers with more resources; but on the other, some of them feel critical and superior in relation to the whole consumer culture; indebtedness has given them 'new values'. Despite this critical stance, small pleasures and aesthetic judgements intermingle in the interviewees' practices of shopping. Thus it becomes evident that degrees of freedom or aestheticism in consumption are not completely reducible to resources.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200001	
J	Hornborg, A								Money and the semiotics of eco system dissolution								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	2			143	162					JUL 1999	1999	This paper argues for a semiotic approach to the problematic interface of economics and ecology. It begins by tracing the origins of materialist science and discussing strategies for transcending Cartesian dualism in the study of human ecology. It then discusses pre-modernity, modernity and postmodernity as transformations of semiotic relations with implications for identity and culture as well as human-environmental relations. The phenomenon of money is identified as a vehicle and epitome of the processes of semiotic abstraction we know as modernity. Various analogies between money and language are scrutinized and rejected. The tendencies of money to dissolve cultural and natural systems are understood as two aspects of a single, ecosemiotic process. Finally, a very general suggestion is offered as to how the idea and institution of money could be transformed so as to check the continued devastation of the biosphere.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000081919400002	
J	Hall, M								Virtual colonization								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	1			39	55					MAR 1999	1999	In many respects, the recent expansion of the Internet retraces the geography of Europe's first colonization of the globe from the late 15th century onwards. Are these new forms of electronic communication a continuation of capitalism's inexorable expansion, or are they symptomatic of a new 'media age' that is qualitatively distinct? This essay explores the comparison between the 'rich trade' of early colonialism and some of the uses of the Internet, and notes the similarities in the marking out of status in hierarchical an? differentiated societies. At the same time, though, the 'death of distance' has significant implications for forms of cultural life, and for new modes of resistance to domination.									4	0	0	0	1	5			1359-1835			WOS:000079136800003	
J	O'Neill, T								The lives of the Tibeto-Nepalese carpet								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	1			21	38					MAR 1999	1999	The popularity of the Tibeto-Nepalese carpet in the European hand-knotted carpet market created a modern industry in peri-urban Kathmandu, Nepal, that established the Tibetan refugee population there as well as a new class of Nepalese entrepreneur. This paper employs Igor Kopytoff's (1986) perspective on the social life of things and Keith Hart's (1982) definition of commoditization to argue that the short career of the Tibeto-Nepalese carpet as an export commodity has been one of increasing homogenization that has transformed the materials, weaving techniques, and meanings of the carpet. Easy access to the lucrative 'middle' markets of Europe has meant that Tibeto-Nepalese carpets are now standardized to compete with other categories of floor coverings, and that the unique hand-knotted quality desired by connoisseurs and collectors is slowly being eliminated.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:000079136800002	
J	Caglar, AS								'Go Go Dog!' and German Turks' demand for pet dogs								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	1			77	94		10.1177/135918359700200104			MAR 1997	1997	Pet dogs are strongly incorporated into social life in Germany, but until recently, they did not enjoy much popularity among German Turks. Although there is no significant change in the general demand for pet dogs in Germany, German Turks have now started acquiring pet dogs. This article focuses on the dynamics behind German Turks' emerging desire and demand for pet dogs in Berlin and argues that their consumption patterns, life styles and tastes, as a transnational collectivity, can only be explained in the context of German society. The commodity aspect of pets is demonstrated by the utilitarian relationship German Turks forge with their pets. This has serious setbacks for their aim of symbolic utility in a society where the commodity aspect of pets is highly suppressed.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:A1997WT04700004	
J	Butler, B								The tree, the tower and the shaman - The material culture of resistance of the No M11 link roads protest of Wanstead and Leytonstone, London								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	3			337	363		10.1177/135918359600100304			NOV 1996	1996	This paper, 'The tree, the Tower and the Shaman', is a bricolage of comment, analysis, critique, oral testimony and myth, the 'subject' of which is the material culture of one specific urban landscape - Claremont Road. My text explores the ways in which a study of material culture offers us an insight into the cultures of resistance that inhabited this particular space in protest against the British National Roads Programme, and similarly, the implications of these findings for subsequent critiques of museology, space and 'everyday life'. Claremont Road, whilst functioning as a critique of the 'auto'-(mobile) culture, also functioned as an auto-critique of both the dominant museum culture and of 'traditional' definitions of material culture. I posit that the culture of resistance created at Claremont, the people who inhabited the space and the rituals performed here functioned as an 'auto'-critic of everyday life, and that the art, the artefacts and the landscape itself were purposefully (re)-created to 'display' and to confront this potential. Thus the Claremont Road experience offers an insight, a clarity: a parody, an inversion and a subversion of 'ordinary' perspectives; with this co-existed/co-exists alternative visions. What emerges from this study are the various, often competing, ways of seeing and experiencing the urban environment, materiality, democracy, partisan politics, social identities, ritual performance, time, place and everyday life. The 'common ground' or praxis is located in the transforming potential of 'contact'.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77400004	
J	Bradley, R								Long houses, long mounds and neolithic enclosures								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	2			239	256		10.1177/135918359600100205			JUL 1996	1996	This paper discusses the relationship between Neolithic long houses, the burial mounds that adopt a similar ground-plan and the first earthwork enclosures in Europe. It considers recent discussions of these monuments by Hodder and Sherratt and proposes a new interpretation of the relationship between these different features. It suggests that the long houses of the Linear Pottery Culture were often abandoned whilst they were structurally sound and that they were then left to decay. This may have happened when one of the occupants died. The distintegration of such houses might have provided the frame of reference for the eventual development of long mounds. On some sites ditched enclosures may have marked the positions of abandoned houses or even those of whole settlements. Like the burial mounds, such earthworks were still being built long after their prototypes had gone out of use.									5	0		0	0	5			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77300005	
J	Kaell, Hillary								Of gifts and grandchildren: American Holy Land souvenirs								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	2			133	151		10.1177/1359183512443166			JUN 2012	2012	Despite significant scholarship in anthropology and tourism studies related respectively to gifts and souvenirs, little is known about why and to whom people give souvenir gifts. Using an American case study, this article shows how Holy Land pilgrimage and its attendant gift-giving are a crucial way that older women navigate tensions specific to the consumer culture and religious patterns of the 21st-century US. By giving souvenirs, pilgrims uphold the importance of individuality (as consumers and as believers), while also fulfilling what they believe is their special responsibility to bolster collective faith, particularly amongst networks of female friends and family. Crucial in this endeavor is how pilgrims negotiate the fluid line between commodity and religious object. Sometimes they imbue these commercial objects with divine presence, thereby creating powerful tools for asserting 'soft' authority at home. At other times, they present religious souvenirs as commodities, downplaying their spiritual value in order to circumvent rejection.									4	0		0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000304884100002	
J	Renshaw, Layla								The scientific and affective identification of Republican civilian victims from the Spanish Civil War								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	4			449	463		10.1177/1359183510382961			DEC 2010	2010	This article addresses the concurrent processes of the scientific and affective identification of human remains, resulting from the excavation of mass graves from the Spanish Civil War. Affective identification refers to the reconstruction of locally meaningful identities, recognition amongst the living of affective bonds with the dead, and the emotions of mourning elicited in this process. Drawing on fieldwork in two rural communities in the Burgos region of Spain, it follows the exhumation of mass graves containing the human remains of local Republican civilians, victims of extrajudicial killings during the Spanish Civil War. The long time lapse between these deaths and current exhumations place these events on the boundaries of living memory, creating challenges for the investigative process. Widespread experiences of political repression during Spain's dictatorship have resulted in a fractured transmission of memories of the dead, making the question of affective and familial bonds with the dead more complex for these communities.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000208349300005

Bouncing off an oral historical account of the site that seems to run against scientific truth claims, the author investigates the story of how knowledge of the site has developed over the last two centuries. Building on previous work that explores the history and practice of archaeology, the article opens up questions of what counts as evidence. Then, taking a cue from more recent work that suggests a more dynamic and open-ended engagement with the landscape, the article turns to examine how the meaning of a site can be made and remade. As part of this endeavour, questions of what as well as who can 'speak' are examined and some space is opened up for the agency of 'minor figures', both human and non-human.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000281678800005

As one of the poorest countries in the world and one only gradually recovering from civil war, there are more immediate concerns. Despite long-term neglect, this article considers whether there is, however, a role for Sierra Leone's cultural heritage in post-conflict recovery. It examines two arenas for the production of Sierra Leone's national past: its list of proclaimed national monuments notionally protected by a Monuments and Relics Commission, and the report of its Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Whilst the rhetoric of the TRC calls Sierra Leoneans to confront their past, history is rewritten in its report and a mythic past of 'peaceful co-existence' posited. To confront Sierra Leone's 'indigenous' cultural heritage is, however, to confront a long history of conflict. The article asks whether it is not better to acknowledge this difficult past rather than deny it.					2nd European Conference on African Studies2nd European Conference on African Studies	20072007	AEGIS, African Studies CtrAEGIS, African Studies Ctr	Leiden, NETHERLANDSLeiden, NETHERLANDS	4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000258031900007

Thousands were erected after the First World War in towns and suburbs across the nation as a community focus for memory, grief, and pride of their soldiers lost in the war. The Victoria Park memorial in Perth, Western Australia, originally constructed in 1917, before the war ended, and replaced in 1957, was a small suburban memorial that was born in the enthusiasm of Empire and the growing concept of Anzac. The biography of this memorial reveals a chequered and contested history typical of many local memorials in Western Australia. Concentrating on the Victoria Park memorial this article seeks to explore the relationships between its physical aspects and setting, its meaning to the community and the linkages between objects and memory.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000251394200002

Based upon a comparison of burial tombs in inalienable, 'ancestral' family land as well as in churchyards and cemeteries, I explore how the painted, polished or embellished cement structures mediate the relationship between people and land, a primary locus of identity in the Caribbean. Examining the ways in which the tombs are decorated and augmented, I argue that the creation, design and redesign of the tomb and its facade are important for the declaration of personhood as well as the positioning of the individual within the family. However, ancestral status is ultimately realized through the neglect and disintegration of these surfaces, the exposed grey concrete materially reuniting the deceased with the land.

J	Chattopadhyay, S								'Goods, chattels and sundry items' - Constructing 19th-century Anglo-Indian domestic life								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	3			243	271					NOV 2002	2002	One of the most common assumptions regarding the culture of British colonialism in India is that the Victorian ideal of separate spheres for men and women found an exaggerated expression in the separation of the colonial bungalow and camp/court. As marginal figures who often disturbed the masculine image and occupation of running an empire, the appropriate role of British women was limited to gracing the household, creating a semblance of 'home'. This reading of British domestic life in India also assumes that the domestic ideology used in Britain to shape a distinction between public and private spheres was not only applicable in the colonial context, but was even more distinctly articulated. Through an examination of written documents describing Anglo-Indian life in Calcutta, housekeeping guides written by British women, house plans, and probate inventories of British residents of Calcutta, I argue that the model of domestic space was formulated on a fundamentally different premise, on an overlap of public and private spheres. And the possibilities of this overlap were utilized by British women to redefine the meaning of Anglo-Indian domestic material culture in late 19th-century India. A spatial inquiry into colonial domestic practices reveals the difficulties and disruptions that such redefinition entailed.									4	0		0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000179758900001

The context is the objectification of 'the Natural' through hegemonic images of mass consumption. The study, which was conducted in a major Israeli hospital, examined physiological features (height, eye colour, skin colour) of the most popular donors. In the highly familistic society of Israel, recipients' choices conformed to images of their own 'natural family'. Within the limits of the family's looks, choices revealed a convergence of specific type of physiognomy - that of the hegemonic Ashkenazi man. While recipients tended to reproduce their own appearance they often 'compromised' it towards the kind of looks constructed as desirable in the mass media. The choice of donors by DI recipients presents an extreme case in which people construct their own family by incorporating hegemonic ideals of mass consumption.									4	0		1	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000174550500004	
J	Grove-White, A								No rules, only choices? Repositioning the self within the fashion system in relation to expertise and meaning: A case study of colour and image consultancy								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			193	211					JUL 2001	2001	This article presents a case study about the way women make decisions about colour and dress prior to, and after a visit to an image consultancy, Color Me Beautiful. It specifically asks to what extent women feel they have benefited from such a consultation in relation to the fashion system and the experience of consumption.The article is divided into two sections. The first section argues that the interviewees, prior to the consultation, had adopted a narrow and restricted mode of decision-making in relation to colour and clothes due to a variety of social and personal reasons. The second section explores the processes by which the majority of interviewees began to gain confidence and a renewed interest in selecting clothes after a colour consultation. Such a technology of the self enabled the respondents to question and 'play' with the fashion system, in such a way that they had not felt able to do before. In particular, the mechanisms of expertise and of meaning were central to this process of change.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000169836700004	
J	Strathern, A; Stewart, PJ								Dangerous woods and perilous pearl shells - The fabricated politics of a longhouse in Pangia, Papua New Guinea								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	1			69	89					MAR 2000	2000	This article approaches the analysis of ambivalence in exchange relations between groups in the Pangia area of the Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea from an unusual angle: the structure and materials of a ceremonial longhouse constructed to house participants in a gift-giving occasion. The sponsor of the feast declared that it was to mark peace and alliance with neighbors, but one of the recipients noted that the types of wood used in the building themselves carried threatening and competitive messages encoded non-verbally. Gifts of pearl shells and pork were similarly interpreted as double-sided: both to repair friendships and to declare enmities. The recipients themselves risked, from their point of view, death in accepting these perilous gifts from a longhouse consisting of 'dangerous woods'. The case study illustrates the possible disjuncture of interpretations of material acts and structures by differently positioned persons in the social arena.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000085507100004

It is argued that a cross-cultural and analytic notion of authenticity can be profitably fashioned once it is noted that its attribution applies to performances and representations which are important because they present something regarded as ontologically inaccessible. The social and political dynamics of authenticity's ontological operations are explored in a reading of recent literature on Primitive Art, ethnographic performances and museums.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200006	
J	Russell, L; McNiven, IJ								Monumental colonialism - Megaliths and the appropriation of Australia's Aboriginal past								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				3	3			283	299		10.1177/135918359800300302			NOV 1998	1998	Colonizers often subjugate the colonized Other as an inferior form of humanity. In the Euro-Australian settler-colonial context such ethnocentric views legitimated the acquisition of indigenous lands. An important element of this process of dispossession was the appropriation of indigenous heritage and the (re)presentation of indigenous archaeological sites as dimensions of European prehistory. In America and Africa last century, interpretations of indigenous sites frequently invoked the prior occupation of an advanced race who had close affinity with the European colonizers. Nineteenth-century representations of stone circles in Australia reveal similar attempts to dissociate Aboriginal people from their past. The stone circles near Mt Elephant in Victoria provide an extreme example of this process wherein a fallacious depiction of indigenous sites as European megalithic structures ensured Aboriginal dispossession and subsequent European (re)possession. The Mt Elephant representations subsequently gave rise to hyper-diffusionist claims early this century that Aboriginal stone circles reflected cultural influences from Egypt. Within the Australian context the processes of dispossession and (re)possession were part of a more encompassing paradigm which held Aborigines to be the living Stone Age ancestors of modern Europeans.									4	0		0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000077074900002	
J	Born, G								Public museums, museum photography, and the limits of reflexivity - An essay on the exhibition - Camera obscured: Photographic documentation and the public museum								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				3	2			223	254		10.1177/135918359800300205			JUL 1998	1998	This essay gives an interpretation of the first exhibition ever held of photographs from the archives of the in-house photographic studios of major public museums. It argues that the photographic images sketch out a rich visual anthropology of public museums as social and cultural institutions; and that this can potentially contribute to an enhanced reflexivity and a cultural politics concerning the museums' own sociality and hierarchy, and their changing representational techniques. This is a reflexivity, however, which the museums seem officially to resist. Museum photography reveals the labour, artifice and construction in the practice of both museum and photographic representations. In contrast with anthropological photography, the 'realism' of museum photography is shown to be characterized by generic and aesthetic instability and experiment, and this is linked to the relatively marginal role of museum photographers within the public museums. Analytically, the essay proposes that semiotic approaches must be broadened beyond textual representations to include the material and social forms of different media. On this basis, despite their apparent convergence in museum photography, the essay develops an analysis of the distinctive nature of the museum and of photography as representational regimes.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000075080900005	
J	Laurier, E					Laurier, Eric/0000-0001-8043-0710			Replication and restoration - Ways of making maritime heritage								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				3	1			21	50		10.1177/135918359800300102			MAR 1998	1998	Early critiques of heritage were often elitist and treated it as a shallow entertainment for the masses based on class-biased accounts of history. Current debate around heritage pictures it as a held where multiple understandings of the past are being produced, not just popular and elitist. This article is devoted to the two social practices of replication and restoration which fabricate heritage objects and understandings of those objects. It follows and interprets the making of two boats: the Matthew, a major maritime heritage project which was related to urban development, and the Elh, a hobbyist's small scale restoration project more related to personal development. Questions are raised about materializing the past, recording materialization in narrative and the performance of masculinity in and through heritage. Based on ethnographic and documentary research this article is written in a style which reveals something of the materials and processes of its construction without that reflexive something becoming everything.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:000075080800002

J	Sassatelli, R								Consuming ambivalence - Eighteenth-century public discourse on consumption and Mandeville's legacy								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				2	3			339	360		10.1177/135918359700200304			NOV 1997	1997	Contrasting diagnoses on commercial modernity have been typically organized by a normative dichotomy between consumption and production that can be traced back to the emergence of a public discourse on commodity circulation in 18th-century Britain. Within this framework, I re-interpret Bernard Mandeville as a proto-sociologist. Mandeville may be considered as the forerunner of a position that neither refuses nor celebrates commercial modernity. He maintains that both hedonistic consumers and avaricious producers are slaves to their passions and yet conceives these passions as the sole ground on which individuals can construct themselves as subjects. The suggestion that commercial modernity fosters different forms of identity permits to consider modern consumer practices as ambivalent phenomena whereby subjects are forced to construct their own selves.

J	Ginsburg, R								'Don't tell, dear' - The material culture of tampons and napkins								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				1	3			365	375		10.1177/135918359600100305			NOV 1996	1996	Feminine hygiene products challenge traditional approaches to material culture. Far from being items of conspicuous usage that might assist in the expression of identity or status, tampons and napkins rarely form part of the visual landscape. Menstrual etiquette requires that women hide the fact of their periods, both in the general and in the particular, from others, especially from men. Accordingly, they take great pains to keep hygiene products out of sightStudy of over 150 boxes of sanitary goods reveals how the design of the objects and of their packaging can be read as encouraging private, discreet consumption. Taking as my starting point the premise that what is missing from the environment is as significant as what is present, I argue that through users' efforts to comply with the apparent necessity of hiding these objects and their attempts to justify such absences, tampons and napkins participate in the ordering of their worlds. Specifically, compliance with menstrual etiquette recalls to women their status as objects, diverts their attention, and compels them to participate in the male gaze. Sanitary products' significance as material culture lies in their helping to delineate and affirm the dominant ideology of womanhood.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77400005

The authors explore a selection of First Nations and M (a) over bar ori initiatives that resist or creatively respond to the digitization and electronic dissemination of cultural 'objects', knowledges and landscapes as a continuation of social processes that have dynamically endured over more than two centuries. Their comparison also considers the limitations of conventional law in regard to the protection of indigenous cultural and intellectual property. Expressions of traditional knowledge and culture generally fall outside the protection of copyrights and patents, a situation that is often exacerbated when that heritage assumes digital forms.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000308651500006

This article describes some of these earlier projects, which deployed digital technologies in innovative ways, as part of a broader strategy of artistic and economic revitalization. It outlines Toi Hauiti's continuing efforts to build relationships with holding institutions at home and abroad, and to explore possibilities offered by recent technological developments. Setting this work in the context of similar initiatives on the part of other M (a) over bar ori, with a focus on cultural revitalization and institutional collaboration, we consider the role of digitization in cultural endurance and dynamism, offering a critical view of emergent concepts including 'digital taonga' and 'virtual repatriation'.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000308651500002	
J	Williams, Howard								Ashes to asses: an archaeological perspective on death and donkeys								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	3			219	239		10.1177/1359183511412880			SEP 2011	2011	This article considers the Donkey Sanctuary, Sidmouth, Devon, UK, as an example of how animal rescue centres and sanctuaries have developed in the UK over the last 30 years as a new form of charity-run commemorative landscape. Human ashes are scattered in the Sanctuary grounds, memorial plaques cover the buildings of the Sanctuary, and many more are set on benches and beside memorial trees around the donkey paddocks. Through text and material culture, these memorials constitute a commemorative parity between people and animals in death, and the Donkey Sanctuary has become a complex memorial landscape. Using a sample of over 500 memorials from the Sanctuary's grounds, the article explores the use of material culture in creating an emotive and utopian 'donkey heaven' in the contemporary Devon landscape.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000304882700001

The significance of pigs has been explored in relation to other cultures, notably Papua New Guinea, but work on the animal's importance in British culture is less well documented. Taking Baudrillard's concept of a system of objects, this article links the pig to other objects of material culture and demonstrates how the pig represents aspects of touristic identity and practice and can also be seen to speak for elements of British identity.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000304882500003

Specifically, it examines the production and uses of chapbooks within poetry communities. Chapbooks are cheaply produced booklets of poetry that are distributed hand-to-hand rather than through institutionalized publication and distribution systems. The analysis draws from in-depth interviews with poets and ethnographic observation of literary events. By outlining the creation and deployment of chapbooks, a case is made for the centrality of material objects in constitutive social interactions. It is argued that material objects are both cultural products and cultural producers, not only because of their physical characteristics, but because of the ways in which they circulate.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000304882200003	
J	Feuchtwang, Stephan								Exhibition and awe: regimes of visibility in the presentation of an emperor								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	1			64	79		10.1177/1359183510394942			MAR 2011	2011	As a publicly funded institution, the British Museum has a mission to draw in a public that might not otherwise visit a museum. For this purpose, it puts on exhibitions such as the series on emperors, for which a special exhibition space was created under the dome of the Reading Room. The first exhibition (followed by exhibitions on Hadrian, Shah Abbas and Moctezuma) was a show of 20 terracotta figures from the complex of the Chinese First Emperor's tomb, on display between September 2007 and April 2008. The result of years of planning and diplomatic negotiations, the exhibition proved to be a blockbuster success for the British Museum. This article is a revised version of the William Fagg Lecture delivered by the author in 2007. It addresses and compares the particular regimes of vision entailed in exhibition, rather than permanent museum display, and those that are assumed to have informed the creation of the First Emperor's tomb in the 3rd century BCE - the interaction between what can and what cannot be seen, ways of making the invisible apparent and of imagining it.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000304882200004

J	Herva, Vesa-Pekka								Maps and magic in Renaissance Europe								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	3			323	343		10.1177/1359183510373979			SEP 2010	2010	Contextual and interpretive approaches have broadened perspectives on historical cartography since the 1980s, but maps still continue to be understood as a means of encoding and communicating spatial information and ideas. These established approaches to maps, however, are embedded in modernist assumptions and may misrepresent the function and meaning of maps, especially in contexts such as Renaissance Europe. This article considers the meaning of the magical associations and aspects of Renaissance maps from a relational perspective. It is argued on historical and theoretical grounds that maps engaged, and were recognized to engage, directly with the workings of the world and thus exercised causations of a magical kind. The explicit magical associations of cartography waned towards the end of the 17th century, but the magic of maps became hidden rather than lost in the process.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000281678800004

The work of surfaces: object worlds and techniques of enhancement in the ancient Andes								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	3			259	286		10.1177/1359183510373986			SEP 2010	2010	This study is an examination of techniques in the Recuay culture (1-700 AD) of ancient Peru. In addition to identifying things that look alike, it reviews different procedures by which they were made to resemble each other. The author examines shared techniques across different media and forms, which helped to shape a general noble aesthetic. Three main points are discussed: first, the techniques share a similar emphasis on enhancing surfaces by conceiving and applying the designs in terms of their negative space or adjacent background. Second, the different technical procedures constructed the exterior worlds of chiefs, their social and physical structures, by saturating special objects and settings with surface elements related to nobility. Finally, it is suggested that the techniques distinguished Recuay value systems from those of neighbouring groups and cultures.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000281678800001

In contrast, repatriation is here considered as an expression of kinship and as a means of producing collective memory and identity. This article considers the repatriation process undertaken by the Haida First Nation to return their ancestors' remains from museum collections with a particular focus on the material culture made by Haidas to remember, respect and rebury their ancestors. Joined through shared, embodied experiences of making, using and encountering artefacts, it is argued that the repatriation process has reinforced kinship relations and identity through the production of collective memory.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000279766400002

In particular, it pursues an understanding of the kinds of relations that are seen to emerge between the practitioners of these cults and the spirits of the dead - relations produced through their varying interpretations and uses of 'matter', in which corresponding moral implications obtain. The author further examines the importance of 'things' and their absence through an ethnographic analysis of the radically diverging discourses on the nature of spirit mediumship among competing spiritist groups in Havana. At one end of the spectrum lies the highly syncretic practice of espiritismo cruzado ( crossed spiritism), characterized by its cosmological and ritual inclusivity, while at the other end is the doctrine-based espiritismo cientifico, where a popular concept of science places stricter limits on what can be understood as legitimately 'spiritual'.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000275846300003

Productive spaces have been transformed into post-mining and post-agrarian landscapes. The aim of this article is to analyse representations and perceptions of surroundings in these contexts through the discourse of those who have experienced these changes most acutely: farmers and miners. This interpretation invites reflection regarding the concept of nature in the western world. Nature is one of our most genuine cultural creations, but we cannot ignore that, in addition to its discursive dimension, it also has a perceptive component. Hence, the analysis carried out here seeks to gain a more in-depth understanding of the perceptive frames through which nature acquires meaning and significance. The dual perceptive and discursive dimension of nature yields a more comprehensive understanding of how landscapes become spaces for resistance and identity.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000266373900001

It addresses the socio-symbolic significance of the technology, as reflected in the domestic positioning and care afforded to radio sets. Radio brands, durability, disrepair and repair are also discussed in the context of poverty, the maximization of future exchange values and the long-term extraction of maximal use values. The article addresses notions of mundane everyday object enlivenment and concludes by suggesting that the meaning invested in certain objects, in this instance radio, is characterized by a process of ongoing economic and semantic investment that serves to maintain the object as a source of information, marker of social status, modernity and symbol of global connection.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000230513100002

This article, presenting a re-reading of its spatial characteristics, is part of a larger project concerned with revealing the layers of cultural meaning invested in a building conventionally regarded as a work of abstract modernism. It sets out to develop a reinterpretation of the building through a phenomenological approach based on a multi-dimensional exploration of its design and occupation, bringing to the fore issues of perception and embodiment, or 'being-in-the-world', at individual and collective level.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000227729700001

The author proposes that archaeology can be conceived and experienced as an embodied and performative practice: the Prambanan site has been incorporated in the archaeological process of dance movement reconstitution and its re-embodiment. This in turn has enabled a choreography of the site through an exploration of the architecture/dance relationship, mutually inscribed as a corporeality.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000227729700002

This research, which was published in 1998, showed that despite the ubiquity of jeans, each pair has individual identifying characteristics caused by the manufacturing process and by wear, and that these might be used as evidence in the identification of criminal suspects. What the FBI research also inadvertently illuminated was an otherwise hidden relationship between garment, maker and wearer, in an effective - if accidental reversal of commodity fetishism.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000225270800004

First Nations struggle to fit their concepts of ownership into western ones, where objects are viewed as alienable. As an alternative, the art of John Powell and Marianne Nicolson depicts a 'figurative repatriation' that does not rely on either the courts or museums to recognize legal or moral ownership. I argue that these contemporary artworks are social agents, which bring First Nations cultural objects home by staking out territory within museums. These 'artist warriors' forcibly recover (both literally and metaphorically) First Nations objects on display in foreign settings and reinscribe meaning at the level of the personal and the communal. They make objectified assertions of native identity that reclaim the right to self-definition. Moreover, these claims are made all the more powerful through their conscious location within an oppositional discourse framed by the Canadian western art world.					101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association101st Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 20-24, 2002NOV 20-24, 2002	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	NEW ORLEANS, LANEW ORLEANS, LA	3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000222829500004	
J	Geismar, H								The materiality of contemporary art in Vanuatu								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				9	1			43	58		10.1177/1359183504041089			MAR 2004	2004	Close examination of material forms and the social relations within which they are embedded soon reveals that things have the capability to affect the way people think. Here, I focus on the recent development of the category of contemporary art in Vanuatu, a nation comprising over 70 inhabited islands in the south-western Pacific ocean. Contemporary art in Vanuatu is a local classification that draws on both traditional objects and iconographies to create new objects in new media, thus making fundamental material distinctions between image and object, traditionalism and contemporaneity. Appropriating Gell's invocation to practise 'methodological philistinism', I came to realize during fieldwork, that artworks as well as artists were able to effect material negotiations between often competing rhetorical distinctions. In this way, the material distinctions made on the sites of objects categorized as 'art' reflect a series of cross-cultural encounters and exchanges. Here, understanding the materiality of art objects themselves, and the material concerns of their producers allows the anthropologist to disentangle complex sets of cultural classifications and values.

It outlines the process of consultation with community members and of the discovery of the historical context and meanings surrounding the hair. These meanings are emotive because of the conjuncture of Ojibwe beliefs about hair with the history of the cutting and analysis of hair by Whites as part of attempts to control Ojibwe people in various ways. The article also explores the implications of current theory about material culture which sees artefacts as points of contact between peoples, and which focuses on tracing the movements and shifting meanings of artefacts as a way of understanding the relations between the peoples involved.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000181720000004	
J	Were, G								Objects of learning - An anthropological approach to mathematics education								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	1			25	44		10.1177/1359183503008001761			MAR 2003	2003	Over the last two decades there has been a proliferation of studies in ethnomathematics dedicated towards shedding light on its importance in enhancing education (cf. Bishop, 1988; Gerdes, 1985). Many ethnomathematicians have utilized the object world as a tool in the learning of mathematical concepts, but little research to date has focused on the role of objects as agents that activate mathematical thought. In this article I argue that the material qualities of objects can mobilize mathematical thinking and act as vehicles for learning. I show that geometric patterns incised on traditional arts and crafts are effective tools in the mathematics classroom in cultures that tend towards visual forms of knowledge. Anthropology is ideally suited for this type of study and as I aim to show, an ethnographic approach can give valuable insights into education and knowledge technology.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000181720000002

J	Tan, CK								Syncretic objects - Material culture of syncretism among the Paiwan Catholics, Taiwan								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	2			167	187					JUL 2002	2002	This article is concerned with the material support and expression of religious syncretism. A wooden carving, 'The Paiwan Cross', in an aboriginal Catholic Church of Taiwan, is the focus of my analysis. This carving, characteristic of the mixture of traditional imagery and Christian imagery, is a historical product of local Catholics' path towards syncretism. I thus consider it as a 'syncretic object'. By examining the historical and social process of the production of this cross and other syncretic objects, I investigate their significance in the emergence and reproduction of local Catholics' identity. The social agency of syncretic objects in mediating and reconciling traditional religion and Catholicism will be discussed. I argue that their agency should be understood in terms of 'participation' rather than Gell's concept of 'captivation' as can be seen in his Art and Agency (1998).									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000177429200003	
J	Bolin, H								Animal magic - The mythological significance of elks, boats and humans in north Swedish rock art								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	2			153	176					JUL 2000	2000	This article discusses the mythological significance of the three most frequently occurring rock art motifs in the middle of northern Sweden, that is of elks, boats and humans. It is here suggested that the most frequently depicted motifs can be related directly to potency in societies practising shamanism during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. The close relationship between rock carvings/paintings and water is emphasized as important when understanding the mythological message expressed in the rock art. It is furthermore assumed that some of the images of elks, boats and humans may portray the experience of the ritual conductor in his/her attempt to communicate with the spiritual world.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000088417900002

JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	3			283	302					NOV 1999	1999	Does the collection of archaeological and ethnographic material created by Sir John Lubbock shed light on the nature of late 19th-century English society, and Lubbock's role within it? I am currently undertaking research' into this very question, exploring the depths of potential meaning held by a selection of artefacts now housed at Bromley Museum(2) and the British Museum. This article proposes a methodology for carrying out such a collection analysis, as a form of discourse analysis, and summarizes a few of the conclusions and ideas that are beginning to emerge from its application.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200003

In particular, the history of one domestic craft, rag rug making, is explored in its relation to the development of the textile industries and paper manufacture, from the end of the 18th century onwards. The strange absence of the rag rug from Elizabeth Gaskell's industrial novel Mary Barton (1848) is scrutinized, in order to further explore the representation of working-class life, in literature and history: by social investigators and novelists in the past, and by modern historians. Questions are then raised about the uses to which these representations and accounts have been put, in a modern class society.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000077074900001

When Kachchhe people say that they 'wear a house and live in a cloth' they are expressing their own cultural idea, utilized for analysing how meanings are made out of Kachchhe material culture, to represent the ideology of hospitality and the structural events of visiting and social exchange.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:000075080800003

Though they are objects of contemporary material culture, these artefacts derive from the Vietnam War era. They have hitherto been absent from the anthropological literature of material culture studies. Inscriptions engraved on behalf of former owners give insights into the attitudes and feelings of soldiers from that time in that place. The social lives of these Zippos have moved through stages of ignition and war comment to become expensive memorabilia for sale in Vietnamese market places. Foreign visitors to Vietnam acquire them in their thousands, selling them at significant markup in their home countries. Vietnam Zippos have become palimpsests for one way modern communist Vietnam, with a clear view of independence and history, has moved into the present and future world capitalist system while countenancing ironic representations of its past.									3	0		0	0	3			1359-1835			WOS:A1997WT04700003

Rather than take either of these positions, they instead set out an argument for approaches that allow them to modulate between these understandings whilst treating both as relational. Taking such a position allows them to consider how things endure through time without returning to any notion of essence. They explore the theoretical arguments through an analysis of one particular enduring material phenomenon: the Neolithic chambered tomb of West Kennet.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000002

Using interdisciplinary methods, the authors map the material practices of shrine-making, examine their historical and social contexts, and investigate their contemporary cultural meanings and values. The Mauritian tradition draws important parallels to what scholars have termed 'spontaneous shrines' but is a singular material expression of popular religion that is deliberate, often durable, apolitical, profoundly religious, and inextricably tied to the supernatural. In Black River, the majority of roadside shrines are grounded in a local folk Catholic tradition, derived from beliefs about the power of saints in everyday lives, the co-dependent relationship between the living and the dead, and the omnipresence of evil in the world. These shrines are complex sites that materially locate Catholic believers in the country's varied ethnic geography, yet they also work as an articulation of popular religion that creates a unique intercultural space.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000343637700002

In arguing that processes of thermal exchange are outcomes and expressions of socio-material organization, the authors demonstrate the potential for linking concepts from physics and social science. Drawing on a recent study of air conditioning in the UK, they show that increasingly standardised notions of room temperature have implications for product and building design, and for how energy circulates through the many components and bodies involved. In describing indoor climates in these terms, they develop a social analysis of thermal exchange that is relevant at the molecular level and for long-term trends in energy demand and climate change.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200001

In retrospect, it is easy to see that many of these fears were either overstated or simply misplaced. Nevertheless, the digital threshold has enabled enormous changes to the way in which images are produced, circulated and stored. In this article, the author considers how images testify' in the digital milieu. He approaches this issue by way of several long-standing debates in documentary practice, namely context, access and stance. He then argues that the current shift of the photograph from picture' to data' is driving a related shift in the image archive, creating the conditions for what he calls the operational archive. Operationality has significant implications for developing new protocols for managing image archives that are relevant to historically oppressed groups such as Aboriginal peoples in Australia									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000323896500002	
J	Carr, Gilly								Coins, crests and kings: Symbols of identity and resistance in the Occupied Channel Islands								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	4			327	344		10.1177/1359183512459627			DEC 2012	2012	During the German Occupation of the Channel Islands, 1940-1945, the ratio of occupying soldiers to civilians was higher than anywhere else in Occupied Europe; thus, armed resistance was virtually impossible. In its place, unarmed and symbolic resistance grew in importance, and while the role of this has been played down, such acts, many of which left a material trace, were of great significance to islanders. The case study presented here examines the role of coins and trench art (such as cigarette lighters and badges) made out of coins, which were used as symbols of resistant identity during the German Occupation. It is argued here that coinage is particularly appropriate and versatile for Occupation trench art, made and used by civilians and occupying soldiers alike, because of the key symbols of patriotism and identity that they carry. In this article, the author shows how these symbols were used at different times in the biographical trajectories of different types of trench art made from and with coins, and varied in meaning depending on context and owner.									2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000311695800001

Recycling charity clothing into emergency aid blankets								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	4			389	404		10.1177/1359183512459628			DEC 2012	2012	This article examines the complex interweaving of moral values, material goods and market economies arising where unwanted clothing donated to Western charities is transformed through industrial fibre recycling in India into millions of aid blankets distributed worldwide as humanitarian relief. The commoditisation of the donor's gift, its destruction, transformation and subsequent use as a gift once more reveals how the moral values of Western donors, charities, relief agencies and aid recipients are negotiated through the global used-textile economy. In contrast to contemporary moral discourses on thrift and sustainable consumption practices that promote values associated with longevity, durability and resourcefulness, the ephemerality of the aid blanket made from recycled fibres materialises the tensions and uncertainties surrounding social and economic reconstruction in crisis zones. Through its qualities and affordances, the material is deeply implicated in the construction of moral economies.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000311695800004

What new connections are enabled through the placement of objects within this contact network and what are the new understandings that result? Dynamics of access, ownership and meaning change when museum collections are transformed into digital forms, in ways that require the reconceptualization of digital objects and their relational capacities. In theory and in practice, the 'real' and the digital object are often framed as disconnected and oppositional entities, a separation that hinders approaches to, and uses of, digital forms. Using examples of recent projects at the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and at the British Museum, it is argued that digital contact networks enable the unique qualities of digital objects to come to the fore, providing platforms for effective engagement and digital reciprocation.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000308651500004	
J	Newell, Jenny								Old objects, new media: Historical collections, digitization and affect								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	3	SI		287	306		10.1177/1359183512453534			SEP 2012	2012	Digital resources mobilized by museums, archives and other cultural heritage institutions are opening up collections and vistas onto the past from an increasing variety of perspectives. Digitization is enabling the juxtaposition of material from far-flung repositories and creating new ways of presenting historical insights as well as new types of historical engagements. New media can allow the assemblage of a multiplicity of voices, accounts, songs, and artworks, among other things - layers of meaning that are hard to capture and present in other formats, and which can be especially helpful in uncovering and accommodating non-Western perspectives. At the same time, the relationship of digital objects to 'actual artefacts' requires further consideration. This article investigates the implications of digitizing objects in cultural institutions, and the advantages and disadvantages of this process for those with differing interests in such objects. What are the effects for historical researchers, museum visitors or clan members with special ties to a museum artefact of viewing it on a screen rather than being in the object's presence, holding, seeing, smelling and hearing it, and connecting with the ancestors or relationships it embodies? Case studies from the UK, Australia and the Pacific are explored to address aspects of the impact of digitization initiatives on museum practice and on people's engagements with the past, with a focus on the affective qualities of digital objects.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000308651500005

J	Hidalgo, Emilse B.								Argentina's former secret detention centres: Between demolition, modification and preservation								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	2			191	206		10.1177/1359183512442610			JUN 2012	2012	This article addresses the architectural debates surrounding three Argentinian memory museums: the Rosario Memory Museum, the People's Memory Centre (El Pozo) and ESMA (Navy School of Mechanics). The sites of these museums were used as secret centres of illegal detention, torture and death during the last military dictatorship in Argentina, known as the Process of National Reorganization (1976-1983). The author first examines the specific symbolic dimension of secret detention centres as the material spatial embodiment of the terrorist state. The sites are then discussed in terms of their preservation, modification or destruction as the proposals advanced by the various human rights groups are compared. She argues that the debates surrounding sites like these tend to be a consequence of larger political and social tensions in the public sphere, and that, as sources of conflicting national collective memories, they may be seen as offering alternative spaces to those created by globalization and neoliberalism.									2	0		1	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304884100005

The authors ask how the absences initiated by a death are articulated or materialized when body disposal and memorialization occur outwith a delineated boundary and identifiable buildings, a grave marked with head and kerb stones, and an embalmed body in a hardwood casket. Exploring data generated through an ESRC-funded project, the article examines tensions between the Natural Burial Movement's goals and the practices of particular natural burial ground owners, managers and bereaved users. These practices, the authors argue, reflect the layers of competing orientations towards the landscape and nature that those involved in natural burial are heir to. In this way, the article draws out the ambiguities and contradictions implicit within the social practices that constitute natural burial and the landscapes within which it occurs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304884100001

The author argues that colour provides us with a vital, if underexplored, field for analysing technologies of enchantment and questions of scarcity and waste in relation to the fundamental centrality of art to imperialism. Her intervention considers the ways in which the fetish, alchemy, alien(ating) material practices on the part of artists and the ontology of Sufism became implicated in struggles for power at the level of the political, the aesthetic and the globalizing economic. Although the palette can be thought of as a micro-centre of calculation - displaying as it does a range of hard-won substances from across the globe that wait to be transformed and perhaps sublimated into the aesthetic of empire - it is nonetheless the heterogeneous space for intense debate and violent, ironic Indian elite and subaltern resistance.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600004

Typically, the study of grave goods has fallen within the spheres of archaeological and anthropological research, with sociological theories of material culture considering how objects left behind by the dead form part of the lives of the bereaved. In this article, the author focuses on the objects that are placed with the recently dead in English and American death rituals. She does so by drawing on data collected from a funeral directors' establishment in England and a funeral home in the USA. Based on this research, she concludes that the practice of including grave goods, such as clothing, eyewear, jewellery, photographs and letters in English coffins and American caskets is common and that this practice should not be neglected when considering the death rituals of different contemporary Western societies.									2	0	0	0	1	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600003

Breaching the wall of traumatic silence: Holocaust survivor and descendant person-object relations and the material transmission of the genocidal past								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	1			3	21		10.1177/1359183511432989			MAR 2012	2012	Deviating from foundational assumptions regarding the semiotic and performative role of material objects, mementos of traumatic pasts are conceptualized as resisting mnemonic re-presentation and inter-objectivity. In keeping with trauma discourse, souvenirs of deathworlds are depicted as incapable of encapsulating sublime suffering or breaching the wall of silence between survivors and descendants, failing to constitute a material legacy. Rather than act as conduits for 'continuing bonds' with the past and the dead, survivors are expected to disentangle the self from souvenirs of difficult pasts facilitating separation and recovery. Ethnographic interviews with descendants depict the way discursive framing elides the semiotic potential of domestic material traces of the Holocaust and parent-child-object relations engendering intimate inter-corporeality and embodied memory. Object relations are central in the passage between life- and deathworlds, allowing survivor families to sustain the lived memory of the past in everyday life. Findings problematize the discourse of genocidal suffering that overshadows micro-moments of lived experience.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600001

The author thus highlights implicit forms of knowledge underlying material practices about, first, the wearing and layering of highly decorated gowns and, second, the process of creating silk-embroidered motifs (on the outside gown) and inked patterns (on the inside gown) that stand as the objectification and expression of charismatic power through self-display. The author proposes that Hausa wild silk-embroidered gowns constitute a material identity of power in that they materialize individual as well as group social status, prestige, fame and wealth. The empirical materials derive from ongoing fieldwork in northern Nigeria on the production and use of wild silk, a particular substance/material to which mystic properties are attributed and which plays an important role in the empowerment of riga.									2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304883200005

Central to the argument is that such a domain constitutes a specific form of materiality, a diverse field where social significance arises from a long process of entanglement of people with a lived landscape and the many transactions and durations that shaped it. This is explored through artefacts designed to contain 'uncomfortable objects', whose ownership cannot be easily located under Western law. Their second life as heritage results in ambiguous locations and valuations as these artefacts question the legitimacy of the available legal and cultural frameworks for their transferability. Together, the uncomfortable objects and the artefacts that contain them tangibly intervene in contemporary projects and concretize 'past/present systems', forming an empirical object constituted by mutually dependent terms of equal importance. Building upon conversations, observations and participation in community activities in both countries, the article argues for incorporating present-day encounters into the heart of archaeological analysis. The article follows the current search for hybrid methodologies to examine the contemporary settings of archaeological practice, yet it does so by insisting that the past is irreducible to present experiences.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000304882500004

These various processes of materialization, the author argues, are attempts to arrest the ambivalent movement between presence and absence, yet are themselves haunted by the thing itself, which is both insufficient to, yet in excess of, these materializations. In so doing, it engages with broader questions of the nature of the affective presence of human remains, particularly in the context of the postcolonial politic of belonging in settler societies.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000208349300003

This behaviour was condemned at the time as that of 'savages'. However, the author argues that it was a local symptom of the shifts taking place after the Enlightenment in the ways in which human diversity was conceptualized. Civil War soldiers who collected and displayed their enemies' remains did so for some of the same reasons that comparative anatomists had begun to collect, display and study such objects at the time. They, too, assumed that the fundamental material evidence of human differences lay under the skin, in the bones and, above all, in the skull.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000208349300002

It looks at the learning trajectory of young girls and the ways in which they are integrated into domestic craft practices and participate in the execution of particular techniques. The aim of this article is to consider two quite different theoretical approaches to learning in relation to this craft knowledge. The author considers the extent to which girls' learning processes and women's more expert practices reflect key ideas in cognitive anthropology, on the one hand, and phenomenological approaches, on the other. She positions herself between these theoretical approaches, and argues that we need to consider knowledge evidenced in practice as well as language, both from a methodological and epistemological perspective, to allow for a more dynamic and encompassing understanding of learning and knowledge.

J	Avieli, Nir								'AT CHRISTMAS WE DON'T LIKE PORK, JUST LIKE THE MACCABEES' Festive Food and Religious Identity at the Protestant Christmas Picnic in Hoi An								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	2			219	241		10.1177/1359183509103063			JUN 2009	2009	Every Christmas, the tiny Protestant community of Hoi An (central Vietnam) congregates and marks the day with a service, a short ceremony and a communal picnic in the church yard. In this article, based on anthropological fieldwork conducted in the town since 1998, the author explores the meanings of the culinary features of the event. By analysing the dishes and eating arrangements at the picnic, he shows how differing facets of the participants' identity-the religious, the ethnic and the regional-are exposed, defined and negotiated. He argues that, while the eating arrangements represent ethnic Vietnamese identity, the dishes themselves hint at foreignness and 'double marginality': not only of a Christian minority among Buddhists but also of Protestants among Catholics. The author's findings suggest that the complicated relationship between nation-states and marginal religious groups, as well as among members of differing religious communities within the same ethnic group, are often expressed in subtle practices that are easily overlooked by outsiders but are meaningful and evocative for the participants. The discussion focuses on the meaning of the culinary arena as a sphere of socio-religious negotiation, especially within politically authoritative contexts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000266373900004	
J	Clouse, Abby								THE REPATRIATION OF A SOUTHERN CHEYENNE BURIAL AND THE CONTINGENCIES OF AUTHENTICITY								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	2			169	188		10.1177/1359183509103059			JUN 2009	2009	Focusing upon an assemblage of Southern Cheyenne burial objects, the author narrates their trajectory through cultural, temporal, and geographic spaces, tracing contingencies of meaning and use. Collected by a US Army medical officer during the 1860s campaigns against the Cheyenne, this assemblage went from the Army Medical Museum to the Smithsonian Institution, and finally, in the 1990s, was successfully repatriated from the National Museum of Natural History to the Southern Cheyenne. Through the combined use of archival records, historical analysis, and consultation with the Southern Cheyenne repatriation delegate, the author analyzes the continuance and renegotiation of colonial configurations of culture, race, and scientific authority as manifested in shifting formulations of authenticity. She contends that Southern Cheyenne re-interpretations of these objects provide productive reformulations of authenticity, which take into account cultural hybridity, change, and the politics of survival.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000266373900002	
J	Ellen, Roy								A MODULAR APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE TRANSMISSION OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE Nuaulu Basket-Making from Seram, Eastern Indonesia								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	2			243	277		10.1177/1359183509103065			JUN 2009	2009	This article identifies a problem relevant to studies of knowledge transmission, namely the simultaneous membership of some element to several cognitive domains. Knowledge loss in one domain may accelerate erosion in another or, alternatively, maintenance of knowledge in one domain may enable retention of knowledge in another. The more complex the domain, the more this overlap is likely to be significant. The basketry knowledge of the Nuaulu of eastern Indonesia is not a single domain and basket-making not a self-contained autonomous set of practices, but rather contingent upon several overlapping domains. Recognizing this provides a more realistic picture of how knowledge transmission works, both in terms of cognition and enskillment. The concept of 'basket' is ambiguous in Nuaulu thought and practice, generating overlapping categories of material culture: functional and morphological, scientific and local. Similarly, transmission must be understood in terms of overlapping knowledges of non-mutually exclusive domains.					4th International Congress of Ethnobotany4th International Congress of Ethnobotany	AUG, 2005AUG, 2005		Yeditepe Univ, Istanbul, TURKEYYeditepe Univ, Istanbul, TURKEY	2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000266373900005	
J	Isaac, Gwyneira								TECHNOLOGY BECOMES THE OBJECT The Use of Electronic Media at the National Museum of the American Indian								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	3			287	310		10.1177/1359183508095497			NOV 2008	2008	The inaugural exhibits created for the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington DC were met with emotive public debates as to their success or failure to change the ways in which Native American cultures are portrayed in the USA. These debates, however, overlooked the significance of the use of electronic media in the NMAI galleries, their effect on the role of material culture and the subsequent shifts in how the collections were not only displayed, but also experienced by visitors. This inquiry draws on these exhibits for a re-examination of the categories of art/artefact and original/duplicate, exploring how electronic media has transformed the interpretation of the museum 'object'. It employs interviews with NMAI staff to discuss the history and philosophy underlying the introduction of electronic media, and with visitors to contextualize these changes in the interpretation of collections from a broader perspective. In conclusion, it considers the confluence of Native, postcolonial and mediated knowledges presented by NMAI, and the possibility that media technology itself has become the museum object.					104th Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association104th Annual Meeting of the American-Anthropological-Association	NOV 30-DEC 04, 2005NOV 30-DEC 04, 2005	Amer Anthropol AssocAmer Anthropol Assoc	Washington, DCWashington, DC	2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000260339700003	
J	De Jong, Ferdinand								Recycling recognition - The monument as objet trouve of the postcolony								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	2			195	214		10.1177/1359183508090897			JUL 2008	2008	This article examines the recycling of a colonial memorial to African veterans in Dakar, Senegal. This act of appropriation by the Senegalese government radically transformed the significance of the memorial and reconfigured the city's memoryscape. Whilst the Senegalese government thus reclaimed colonial history as constitutive for the postcolony, it simultaneously underwrote a postcolonial claim for recognition. The article examines this case as indicative for a wider trend to claims for recognition for which recyclia seem to lend themselves par excellence. As objects of mimetic appropriation, colonial memorials can be seen as the objets trouves of the postcolony.					2nd European Conference on African Studies2nd European Conference on African Studies	20072007	AEGIS, African Studies CtrAEGIS, African Studies Ctr	Leiden, NETHERLANDSLeiden, NETHERLANDS	2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000258031900005

It transpires that while the impact of mass-media - often held responsible for the extinction of 'authentic' folk art - has been somewhat exaggerated, the argument put for-ward here is that the putative anteriority of a time before representation, is largely an illusion.									2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000254928100002	
J	Wagner, Monika								Hans Haacke's earth samplings for the bundestag - Materials as signs of political unity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				12	2			115	130		10.1177/1359183507078120			JUL 2007	2007	An art work consisting of deposits of earth from each of the constituencies represented in the German Bundestag has been conceived by the New York based artist Hans Haacke for the courtyard of the former Reichstag building in Berlin. Growing plants from seeds of each region symbolizes the unity of Germany after its reunification. Assembling natural materials from different regions of a country or an empire belongs to an enduring tradition of political symbolism. Though often more precious and durable material have been deployed, there are political rituals which focus on lowly earth which represents the country's population. Haacke's art work for the Bundestag seems to actualize the material's political iconography.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000248727400001

The setting for my discussion is the Rai Coast of Papua New Guinea. The article is also about places, and the deep and significant influence that both individual places, and indeed the imagination in relation to the potential of places, can play. It is an opening foray into the nature of various kinds of collaborative and institutional forms in Melanesia, showing, in this case, how the perception of a 'community' relies upon the active and generative differentiation of people and places. Through a mixture of narrative and analytic styles, personal anecdote, reported speech, published authority and descriptive evocation, I demonstrate that on the Rai Coast, landscape and place are not about what is 'out there' beyond people, but are sometimes about what is in people. As such, they are brought into people's projects, and action in relation to them shapes developments around the idea of 'community'.

Founded in 1987 to celebrate the original asylum's centenary the museum commemorates the history of the institution. Its curators are former psychiatric nursing staff. Visitors to the museum include educators, researchers and members of the psychiatric community. This article asks why some people have preserved the 'relics' of past psychiatry. Such collections and museum exhibitions raise fascinating questions about the 20th-century experience of psychiatric institutions, and the role of the museum collection in people's lives. In talking about why and how former staff have struggled to preserve their private memories through collections of physical objects, and by interpreting history inside the space of the museum, the article suggests that historians can make a new contribution to the understandings of psychiatric institutions in histories of 20th-century psychiatry.

J	Van der Grijp, P								Passion and profit - The world of amateur traders in philately								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	1			23	47		10.1177/1359183502007001304			MAR 2002	2002	Within the specific subset of collecting-in-general which is called philately, the twilight zone between exchange for one's hobby (swapping) and professional trade is occupied by enthusiastic collectors who also act as dealers. This article seeks to describe and understand the informal economy of philatelic amateur trade via an economic anthropological perspective by studying particular cases of adult collectors in the Netherlands. It shows how the market can be critical in economically reproducing an endeavour without diluting its cultural 'spirit'. A major question is: what distinguishes amateur trade in philately from the trading practices of professionals? The representations and praxis of philatelic amateur dealers gain relevance within the present-day context of many western societies: people now live longer, there are increasing instances of early retirement, and also a high proportion of unemployed people. Within this context - a conjunction between a cultural phenomenon which has long existed and the specific socio-economic conditions of today - amateur dealers create their own jobs and, in so doing, construct their own social identity.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000174550500002	
J	Arvidsson, A								The therapy of consumption motivation research and the new Italian housewife, 1958-62								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	3			251	274					NOV 2000	2000	This article describes the transformation of the image of the housewife-consumer in Italian advertising during the 'economic miracle' of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Drawing on market research, professional debates and advertising campaigns it argues that motivation research - an originally American market research technique with Freudian origins - was crucial in altering the ways in which advertisers and marketers related to women consumers. Motivation research made advertisers and marketers conceive of consumers as endowed with an intrinsic desire for self realization. The qualitative methodology that it introduced also allowed the marketing profession to observe and absorb the new ways of life that were proposed by the counterculture and the women's liberation movements of the early 1960s. Towards the early 1970s these elements blended into a distinctly 'emancipated' advertising discourse, a 'commodity feminism' where women consumers were encouraged to use consumer goods to mark off an autonomous, individualized subjectivity, rather than to ensure the compliance with traditional gender roles.									2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000165460300001	
J	Strang, V								Showing and telling: Australian land rights and material moralities								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	3			275	299					NOV 2000	2000	This article draws upon landscape theory and studies of material culture to explore the process through which space is humanized, examining in particular how this process legitimizes moral rights to property. Drawing on ethnographic research in the Western Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, it considers some of the performative, representational and material activities through which Aboriginal groups assert their claims to the land.The analysis is placed within the wider historical and political context of the land rights and environmental movements in which ownership of the peninsula is entangled. The Aboriginal community in Kowanyama has primary claims to several thousand square miles of land within and surrounding their 'Deed of Grant in Trust' area, but these are opposed by many local pastoralists, the National Parks service and, to some degree, tourist and environmental groups in the region. The article examines how the construction of performative and artefactual representations of an indigenous cultural landscape enables Aboriginal groups to concretize and communicate their particular moral and political position and challenge European Australians' colonial control over the land.									2	0		0	0	2			1359-1835			WOS:000165460300002

This article contributes to a literature on the intersection between trainers and the individuals who have made' them. However, it asks a parallel question: how do trainers make' the individual, that is to say: it addresses the embodied processes of everyday life and the contribution of technology to the body and its techniques. We argue that the diversification of the trainer parallels the unfolding of particular lives, offering a valuable, if under-utilised resource for making sense of everyday and life course processes of embodied identification.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000350156100002

The author traces the development of the British Standard BS1363 plug-socket assembly and compares it to the European arrangement in order to demonstrate how the banal nationalism' of everyday life is formed and can be seen to be manifest in everyday utilitarian artefacts. A concept of nationhood that is formed in terms of national habitus' is elaborated, the nation is envisaged as being constituted by the socio-technological infrastructures upon which it depends, which are established as being formed by the governmentalities that have allowed them to come into being, and it is suggested that such a system will operate at a range of scales or valencies. By tracing the history of the two examples given, the intention is to demonstrate how each national habitus depends upon a particular technical development shaped by social forces.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000350156100004

Research into OSH typically seeks to solve its perennial problem of improving' workers' health and safety through scholarship dominated by management disciplines, human factors and ergonomic sciences, and psychological and physiological theories. Here, they focus on the example of the safe hand' and its making through the materiality of gels, water and gloves in the work of health care workers. In doing so they show how organizational, environmental, embodied and biographical elements of OSH intersect with institutionalized and personalized constituents of the material and sensory culture of safety amongst health care workers. They argue that material culture studies have a pivotal role in revising the agendas of applied research and intervention.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000345342400004

The inclusion of animals was inhibited by their penchant for movement, which confounded the capabilities of the daguerreotype. Nonetheless, people sought to incorporate animals into portraits, the result often being a smeared image of the being. Rather than viewing this outcome as a failure, the smeared images should be viewed as theoretically and philosophically insightful. On the one hand, the smears suggest the frailty of existence during an era in which disease and death were common, a condition that instigated the creation of lasting daguerreotypes. On the other hand, the smears indicate the transient character of life in all ages, a condition that points toward an altered conception of animal ontology. These social and ontological insights have ramifications for present-day relations.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000329919700003

Their story telling is leavened with a dissonant working imaginary designed to interrupt both itself and the stories. As their stories of their digital lives proceed, however, the carefully contrived, resourceful dissonance unexpectedly recedes as the new and surprising digital lives that form part of their collectives evade the grasp of their interrupting tool.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000323896500006

Incorporating the languages that dominate communication on social networks and image sharing platforms, i-docs are a window onto the changing meaning of images in the context of contemporary digital technologies. In such products, a variety of different kinds of materials (such as videos, photos, sounds, texts, etc.) converge, forcing us to rethink the very meaning of image beyond the field of vision. Fostering new forms of interpretation and exploration of audio-visual materials, these projects also generate new connections between life online and life offline. Informed by the principles of participation, sharing and relationality that inform contemporary social networks, i-docs seem to invite us to engage with the physicality and socialness of everyday life, in other words, to get our hands dirty (again).									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000323896500004

Based on a qualitative study in Denmark about how people use air from the outside and let it into their homes, the article investigates the relation between the air we breathe and learn from and the air we perform', such as airing our homes. The study indicates patterns of use that reflect on air as a vital element in our being-in-the-world as well as being socially and bodily significant for shaping our everyday life. The article begins by showing air as an integrative practice with three dimensions: functional, bodily/sensory and social. It is shown how knowledge of the environment is constructed in the process of practising' air, how this knowledge is transferred into a sense of being-in-the-world and how emotions are part of this becoming.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000320499800005

This democratization is based upon material processes: efforts to increase the affordability, accessibility and mutability of scientific equipment can be observed. In particular, do-it-yourself biology relies on creative workarounds' around objects (to transform and combine them in novel ways) and institutions (to circumvent established university-industry business linkages). By tinkering with objects and sharing knowledge via various communicative devices - websites, blogs, wikis, forums, videos - do-it-yourself biologists aim to create a new, collective and open economy of scientific equipment and render biology more accessible to citizens. A distinct form of individuality is constituted by providing people with access, transforming them into active makers of science, making their bodies/ailments more knowable and demonstrating that one can do it oneself. Do-it-yourself biology thus offers a site for exploring the ethics, boundaries and new forms of sociability for biology.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000320499800002

Material displays, architecture and art visually constructed the New World as an integral, yet inferior, part of the Old World. The commodification of the material culture of the North American Indian reproduced the dominion of the colonial powers but at the same time included the New World in the old. Parallel to this process was the integration of history on the estate. Architecture, the construction of landscape and material culture became an arena for the display of a new, hybrid global culture, signifying the advent of modernity. Although juxtaposed in their display, the New and Old Worlds mingled and created a world of hybridity expressed and executed in the castle and estate of Skokloster.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000320499800006	
J	Sillar, Bill								The building and rebuilding of walls: Aspirations, commitments and tensions within an Andean community and the archaeological monument they inhabit								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				18	1			27	51		10.1177/1359183512473558			MAR 2013	2013	Walls are at the foundation of 'civil society': physical and symbolic barriers that differentiate people and activities. Cooperation in construction work expresses people's aspirations and can be a focus for the development of group solidarity. However, walls change the control and use of space, causing tensions and social divisions. In Raqchi, a small Peruvian village whose houses and fields are located within the ruins of a major archaeological complex, walls are a major concern. The work involved in house building, community projects, a monumental Inka temple and recent heritage reconstruction shows how the choice of materials and techniques is influenced by social relations and labour exchange. Tensions are expressed over land ownership and community priorities as well as with heritage management. The community's identity and status are also strongly influenced by building work that is dependent on the Catholic Church, NGOs, the municipality and the nation state.Walls can be read as a document of this contested history.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000317865400002

Until the last 30 or so years, history had consigned the Moriori people of the Chatham Islands near New Zealand to being defined as extinct and almost landless. Today Moriori are in a spirit of revival and reconnection with their identity and culture. Through the gift of the Traditional Knowledge Revival Pathways (TKRP) software system, laser scanning of r (a) over bar kau momori (tree carvings), and involvement in the Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage (IPinCH) Project, Moriori are developing an extensive database of cultural landscapes, elder stories, traditional practices and digital records of taonga. The next stage of this research will involve development of an intranet guide to taonga Moriori (ancestral artefacts) in overseas collections. Here we explore the methods and technology that Moriori have been using to assist in the process of preserving taonga for present and future generations to enjoy.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000308651500003

This article examines object and subject entanglements that take place at a university museum in northern Norway, and illustrates how objects shift identities as they interact with subjects and how subjects are also affected by the encounter. A relational materialities perspective, which demonstrates how object identity is related to the subject it engages with, allows multiple versions of objects to appear. Working as a certified expert in the university museum, the author aims to address the quandary over future museum collection policies. She argues that collection policies are not only about what to select but also who makes the selection decisions, and the perspectives associated with such choices. If museum collections are based on expert relationships to objects, the quality of the expert needs further investigation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304884100004	
J	Rahmeier, Clarissa Sanfelice								Materiality, social roles and the senses: Domestic landscape and social identity in the estancias of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	2			153	171		10.1177/1359183512443613			JUN 2012	2012	This article provides a multisensory approach to the past and suggests new possibilities for assessing history through the senses. Using a phenomenological approach, the author analyses how the domestic space of Southern Brazilian estancias, ranches dedicated to livestock farming, dynamically influenced the social identities of their inhabitants in the 19th century. She argues that what people saw, heard, smelt, touched and tasted in their daily lives, as well as the intensity and frequency of these sensory experiences, was dependent not simply on their own bodily capability as human beings, but also on their social status. The article also explores how the rancher's house, the slave quarters and the barn, the three buildings that constituted the estancia's core complex, influenced the development of particular body routines and the creation and reproduction of particular somatic spaces. The methodology presented here invites a sensorial exploration of historical sites, contributing to a more humanised account of the relationship between individuals and things.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304884100003

It is suggested that the role of status hierarchies in the public address of the Indigenous societies in British Columbia has been overlooked and that, due to the affective response they invoke, materials that represent these hierarchies are implicated in the contradictory tensions between display and disguise that characterize current status relations.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304883200006

If this is the case, one would expect there to be a subjectivity gap between the social scientist, on the one hand, and the experienced fighter, on the other. This problem is discussed with regard to a Cameroon kingdom of the early 20th century and a fighter in the First World War (as analysed by the historians Stephane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker), which enables the author to make significant comparisons.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304883200002

The article focuses on end-of-life military things, specifically the neglected field of naval vessels. It shows how the social and physical death of naval ships connects to residue military masculinities, particularly through the complexities of souvenir value. Drawing on ethnographic research with veterans' associations, the authors chart how naval ships become ghostly and how this connects with the salvage of personal mementos, often of a military domestic; they go on to describe the ambivalence of these accommodations within a civilian domestic. The article shows how collective practices of ship memorialization disclose a hierarchy of souvenir value and how souvenir salvage constitutes a distributed sociality from the fragments of destruction to own the memory of what is being destroyed. The authors argue that visioning and visualizing the destruction of naval vessels makes ex-naval personnel witnesses to an object death and highlights the fact that resource recovery regimes need to be re-thought through reincarnation; they also show how the reincarnation of 'great things' does not always become them.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304882700005	
J	Bradley, John J.; Kearney, Amanda								'He painted the law': William Westall, 'stone monuments' and remembrance of things past in the Sir Edward Pellew Islands								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	1			25	45		10.1177/1359183510394946			MAR 2011	2011	Early colonial expeditions were responsible for the documentation of the Australian landscape, fauna, flora and the indigenous owners of the land. Today, these documentations remain: locked in archives and hanging on the walls of museums. Visual representations reflect artistic traditions of the time and the curiosities of colonial administrations. In this article, the authors discuss a painting by the artist William Westall, who accompanied Matthew Flinders on his circumnavigation of Australia from 1802. Westall's paintings depict objects of indigenous Australian material culture that hold significance for the Yanyuwa, indigenous owners of land and sea throughout the Sir Edward Pellew Islands, Australia. These objects are of the highest value to the Yanyuwa and are linked to ceremonial practices no longer performed. By direct reference to Westall's painting and Yanyuwa ethnography, the authors examine how people conceive of this material culture as something powerful as well as the nature of re-engagements that result from triggers to memory.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304882200002

Engaging the problem of alternative modes of spatial perception, the author describes how the act of drawing can become a tool of ethnographic exploration. With insights gained through sketching-mediated encounters with artists, the article shows the relevance to Tiguan art of Ingold's recent arguments about lines as an organic device of narrative and visual ordering. Where formal spatial perspective offers a vocabulary of hierarchical order - foreground, background, vantage point - lines invoke movement, duration and interchange, which become recurrent issues for Tiguan artists.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000304882200001	
J	Singh, Kavita								REPATRIATION WITHOUT PATRIA Repatriating for Tibet								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	2			131	155		10.1177/1359183510364079			JUN 2010	2010	Most claims for the repatriation of artefacts are made by newly sovereign nations, or by communities emerging from a period of domination. They dispute the legal and moral rights of former powers to remove objects from their original home. What meanings can 'repatriation' have for Tibet, which exists both as a province of China and as an exile community that has established a 'virtual nation with a government-in-exile? This article studies some Tibetan artefacts that have been in circulation since 1959, to show the ambiguities surrounding ideas of a 'home' for such objects; in this context, removing an object from its original location can be an act of theft and of salvage. The author demonstrates how the idea of 'repatriation' is often invoked in relation to the current global circulation of Tibetan artefacts in order to make claims about legitimacy and nationhood.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000279766400001	
J	Andermann, Jens								TOURNAMENTS OF VALUE Argentina and Brazil in the Age of Exhibitions								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				14	3			333	363		10.1177/1359183509106424			SEP 2009	2009	The 'Age of Exhibitions' included the newly independent Latin American nation-states almost from the very outset. This article studies the complex strategies of material and visual display, architecture and writing through which representations of Argentina and Brazil were fashioned at the world fairs. It argues that, as peripheral affiliates of the emergent capitalist world-system, Latin Americans had to negotiate the material and symbolic value of their commodities and cultural samples with a host of agents, including not just foreign audiences but also exhibition organizers, artists, architects, and so on. National pavilions, therefore, rather than being seen as material texts authored by state governments, could be understood as 'contact zones', performative spaces for the exchange of objects, gazes and words. The article concludes by comparing the world fairs with trade and industry exhibitions held in Brazil and Argentina themselves. In these, it observes the emergence of a dissident figure of national modernity as 'development', challenging hegemonic regimes of value.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000268332900003	
J	Bonshek, Elizabeth								When speaking is a risky business: Understanding silence and interpreting the power of the past in Wanigela, Oro province, Papua New Guinea								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	1			85	105		10.1177/1359183507086220			MAR 2008	2008	The increased importance placed upon interaction between 'source communities' and museums which hold cultural heritage collections has been described by Peers and Brown (Museums and Source Communities. A Routledge Reader, 2003, p. 11 as 'one of the most important developments in the history of museums'. This interaction entails the relinquishment of the museum's authoritative voice and the empowerment of the indigenous voice. This development assumes that source communities would have something to say about museum collections. My experience in a rural community in Papua New Guinea revealed complex dynamics surrounding museum objects. In Wanigela, questions about objects in museum collections were often met with hesitancy and silence. It was only when these objects became relevant within the context of local issues, embedded within social relationships between people that silences were eventually broken and the diverse significances surrounding silences emerged. An approach driven by academic or museological concerns over collections proved to be problematic in identifying the contemporary significance of the collections for Wanigelans.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000254928100005	
J	Balasescu, A								After authors - Sign(ify)ing fashion from Paris to Tehran								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				10	3			289	310		10.1177/1359183505057344			NOV 2005	2005	This article explores the relationship between aspects of copyright law (as understood in France), copying as a practice employed or condemned by fashion designers (sometimes both at the same time), and the meaning that 'authorship' has for the political economy of fashion production. The empirical substance is the result of 18 months of research in the fashion industry in two locations: Paris and Tehran. Foucault's archaeological method applied to 'the author' points to the constellation of conditions that make the existence of the author possible. This study follows 'the author' in two differently located fields of power, interrelated through similar and communicating practices. The first part of the article presents the historic formation of legal authorship in the (Paris) fashion industry, the practices of authoring fashion, and the current legal debates connected to the European Law. The second part is an ethnography of the dynamic of authoring practices in Tehran.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000233337900004	
J	Pigliasco, GC								Lost in translation: From omiyage to souvenir - Beyond aesthetics of the Japanese office ladies' gaze in Hawaii								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				10	2			177	196		10.1177/1359183505053074			JUL 2005	2005	Centering on the analysis of the omiyage (gifts brought back from trips for family, friends and colleagues) in Japan, this article describes the Japanese office ladies' (OLs) practices of consumption in Hawaii. In contemporary Japan, foreign goods, especially brand name ones, are not only bearers of intrinsic aesthetic value but are forms negotiating OLs' emancipatory social action. Based on interviews with OLs visiting Hawaii's shopping scene between 1994 and 2004, this article explores the nature and evolution of the Japanese omiyage, analyzing its metamorphosis and trespasses, along with issues of internationalization and consumption. These changes delineate an historical transformation from a traditional culture characterized by a non-individualistic, others-oriented omiyage practice, to a material one, self-oriented and characterized by a form of Occidentalism, fetishized fads and style-status symbols.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000230513100005

J	Pandya, V								Nose and eyes for identity - Accoutrements and enumerations of ethnicity among the Jatha of Kachchh								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				7	3			295	328					NOV 2002	2002	Among the Muslim Jatha of Kachchh (western India), the differing practices of pastoral nomadism and settled agriculture create a division of the overall Jatha community into three subgroups. These differences are maintained and are projected within each subgroup of the community but find expression in its communal myths, history and ideology. Each subgroup symbolizes its identity, creating a non-verbal discourse made up of certain essential values. Within this discourse, the value of each subgroup's individuality is important, but this individuality does not prohibit the integration of all the groups into one interdependent whole. For the Jatha, a material culture has been formed to sustain the cultural value, in relation to other communities, of being one distinct, ethnic group comprising separate subgroups. As an outcome of the Jatha interpretation of their history, mythology, and Islam, the whole community is bound together by the choice of dress, of ornament, and of each subgroup's differing but interdependent economic practice. Through examining the ways in which subgroups within the Jatha community express their identities, and thereby contribute to the identity of the whole community this article examines the forms and processes of materiality and the accoutrements of identity. It further considers the relationship between people and objects, and the connection between symbolism and materiality, which combine to construct a social entity.									1	0		1	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000179758900003

J	Rosin, RT								From garden suburb to olde city ward - A longitudinal study of social process and incremental architecture in Jaipur, India								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	2			165	192					JUL 2001	2001	In post-Independence India, new colonies of garden suburbs served an educated citizenry to integrate science and nature into their daily life. However, one such colony of bungalows (kothi) and gardens, begun in Jaipur in the 1950s, after two generations of incremental construction, has become in the 1990s similar to an old city ward with towering courtyard houses (haveli) abutting the property lines. This longitudinal study compares the middle class occupants' initial aspirations with real outcomes as documented in the materiality of built form. The biography of these buildings reflects not only a quest for a life style of class, but the adapting of site and building to make secure one's livelihood and heritage for one's descendants, and to manage relations with one's neighbors. The built environment is not simply an outcome of regulation, design, and willful intent. The levels of agency and the variety of actors are multiple and complex, demanding an analysis of social interaction and an assessment of aggregate outcomes.					28th Annual Conference on South Asia28th Annual Conference on South Asia	OCT 14-17, 1999OCT 14-17, 1999		MADISON, WISCONSINMADISON, WISCONSIN	1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000169836700003	
J	Chaimov, J								Hummel figurines - Molding a collectible germany								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				6	1			49	66					MAR 2001	2001	How are we to understand the many-stranded, even contradictory, ways an artifact projects an ethnic image across the space of the contact zone? A staple of souvenir shops in German-American tourist towns and the focus of an entire museum in Texas, diminutive porcelain Hummel figurines have been selling an image of Germany to a world audience since their appearance in 1935. Various entities - corporate, civic, national - have sought to control or exploit the ethnic image that Hummels carry, molding them into what one might call 'ideological souvenirs'. But what ideologies do they sell, what messages of ethnicity do they convey? Strategic efforts to deploy Hummels as ideological souvenirs run up against shifting historical conditions and conflicting interpretations of the figurines' symbolic meanings. The moving target of historical reception thus exposes the dialectic of image-control and the resilient self-invention of the artifact.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000167925200003

As a cultural biography of this national artifact, this paper focuses on the four main media through which the Bell has over time gained the exposure needed for its consecration in the public mind. The media of presenting the Bell include (1) the changing ways in which it has been exhibited in Philadelphia for the public and (2) the many train journeys across the United States the Bell took from 1885 to 1915 to visit various industrial expositions. The media of representing the Bell include (3) the many mid- to late-19th-century mythic stories that portray it as a key figure in both the American Revolution and the early 19th-century antislavery movement in the United States and (4) the post-1876 growth of the use of its image in advertising and tourism.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000079136800004

By taking up the invitation to undisciplinarity offered by this journal, it is possible to challenge that definition of design which blocks discussion of it as a common activity and enables its redefinition as an everyday practice of modernity. This essay focuses on the transformation of the visually banal 'occasional table' into the stylish 'coffee table' and its popular appropriation as symptomatic of the partial welcome given to modern design in the post-Second World War British household. The informal conviviality embodied in the coffee table gave access to a sector of the population not in possession of the taste required by the rules of 'good design' to some of the innovatory social features of modernity.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:000073336000001

As a promoter of the reflexive project of the self, art is especially valuable for adolescents for whom negotiating life-style choices and generating mastery over circumstances of uncertainty and multiple choice is especially intense. This paper concerns narrative identity and the way it is constructed by Finnish adolescents via their accounts of their artistic activity and products. The stories regarding the pictures that they had once produced gradually opened up to a world of interpretations reflecting the adolescents' present circumstances. Thus, although indebted to the motifs in the concrete pictures, the stories reached out far beyond what could be seen in them. These stories reproduced conventional gender identities of girls being compassionate and boys being independent. However, the very process of making art had a counterbalancing effect as it provided them a relief from the very pressures of conforming to strict gender roles. Altogether I examine art and telling about it as a prop to the adolescents' ongoing identity-formation in which the two explicit 'others' promoting and challenging their self-reflexive projects were their own pictures and myself, as their interviewer and audience.

Although its history can be traced back thousands of years, Dong culture is essentially non-textualized. It takes forms in 'images', such as music, performance, textiles, social customs, rituals and, most importantly, architecture. In the practice of making and inhabiting their architecture, such as 'wind-and-rain bridges' and 'drum towers', the Dong have been able to strategically and inventively react to the historical and political constructions, particularly in the mode of textualization and colonization, form the Han Chinese and other ethnic groups and to survive and enhance their cultural ethnicity in the process of cultural reconstruction.									1	0		0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77300004

I begin by discussing the way in which mural paintings have become a key signifier of the threat of Republican violence. The paintings have come to stand in for the unseen gunmen themselves who are depicted as a product of the decaying urban fabric and represented by it. But the paintings are also used to redefine the working-class estates as ghettos, a term which helps to frame the context of the violence as other and distant from British political life. In contrast to the violence of the poor ghetto dwellers the middle classes are shown as responsible and law abiding. They are peaceful men and women living in the respectability of the suburban landscape.As well as contrasting ghettos and suburbs, many dramas further create an opposition between the violence of urban life and the peaceful integration of rural life, where sectarian divisions are transcended by individual contacts. However, this peace is readily disrupted by the violent men of the physical and political extremes. Across a broad range of works the Northern Ireland Troubles are being depicted as a product of the Irish character, which is in part produced and symbolized by the natural landscape rather than the result of a political and social landscape. However, I conclude with a brief survey of recent works that suggest alternative readings of Irish history.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-1835			WOS:A1996WE77200002	
J	Bajracharya, Sepideh								Measures of violence: Rumor publics and politics in the Kathmandu Valley								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	4	SI		361	378		10.1177/1359183515601453			DEC 2015	2015	Rumor is often depicted as a discourse predicating acts of popular violence - the unconscious medium for a decisive act of communal, mass and/or subaltern violence. This article presents a different perspective on how rumor relates to violence - instances of where rumor features as the contemplated subject of public inquiry regarding acts violence not yet formed, but considered imminent and likely as a condition of rumor's possibility. Violence appears here as a spectral possibility contingent on how a rumor's aesthetic', or material and circulatory expression, is likely to affect events of violent and political consequence beyond the coordinates of official publics and politics. Violence also appears in the habituated bodies, gestures, discourses, and spaces that encounter rumor and violence as such - material, spatial, and temporal orientations reflective and productive of chronic states of public and political precarity. The author's argument is based on ethnographic work conducted in the Kathmandu Valley during the state of emergency underwriting King Gyanendra's regime, and the riots following the abduction and execution of 12 Nepali service workers in Iraq that broadsheets labeled as one of the Valley's first conflagrations of communal violence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200002

J	Jolaosho, Omotayo								Political aesthetics and embodiment: Sung protest in post-apartheid South Africa								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	4	SI		443	458		10.1177/1359183515601454			DEC 2015	2015	In South Africa, freedom songs and accompanying dances played a critical role in mass mobilizations to combat apartheid and they continue to flourish post-apartheid. Using ethnographic studies of collective demonstrations in the Johannesburg metropolitan area between 2009 and 2010, this article investigates the continued salience of such performances for contemporary protesters. The author argues that the political significance of freedom songs involves not only their eruption as a critique of a broader society, but also their varied contributions toward a shared sensory disposition and sensibility among the marginalized. If, as French philosopher Jacques Ranciere states, politics is an eruption or break away from the sensible, then attention to song embodiment reveals regenerative possibilities that exist along with the transgressive potential of political performances. An embodied consideration of political aesthetics therefore expands analysis of political intervention as not only transgressive but also as generative of personhood and collectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200007	
J	Mehta, Deepak								The Ayodhya dispute: The absent mosque, state of emergency and the jural deity								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	4	SI		397	414		10.1177/1359183515607093			DEC 2015	2015	The Ayodhya dispute is located neither solely within the institutions of the nation state, nor within networks of religious associations, but at the crossroads of secular and religious culture in India. At its heart lies the place of the Hindu god Rama, constituted in law as a jural person. How do we understand the emergence of this jural deity in the dispute? Focusing on appellate judgments that addressed the demolition of the Babri Mosque on 6 December 1992, the article argues that the legal evaluation of specific claims rested on a contest over asymmetric temporalities. Prior to the demolition, judicial accounts referred to the site as a disputed area' or the Ayodhya dispute'. After the demolition, this literature named the disputed area as the Babri Masjid. It was as if the Hindu deity, Rama, would fill in the space of the absent mosque. The author shows how the presence of the deity rested on an understanding of the sublime that was simultaneously political and religious.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200004	
J	Mookherjee, Nayanika								The raped woman as a horrific sublime and the Bangladesh war of 1971								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	4	SI		379	395		10.1177/1359183515603742			DEC 2015	2015	This article examines the relationship between aesthetics and politics when invoking the imagery of war-time rape. It explores the prevalent way in which the raped woman of the Bangladesh war of 1971 is imagined in contemporary Bangladesh through the circulation of rumours, narratives of encounters and photographs. In 1971, faced with a large number of rape survivors after the war, the Bangladeshi government publicly designated any woman raped in the war a birangona (meaning brave woman/war-heroine). Over the last 40 years in Bangladesh, there has existed a public memory of wartime rape through various literary, visual and testimonial forms. These aesthetic representations of the war-heroine can be understood through Ranciere's politics by other means - of that of the distribution of the sensible - through the horrific sublime figuration of the birangona. As an idea that is not readily apparent, these diverse oral, visceral and visual strategies make the birangona visible and comprehendible as bhoyonkor (horrific). The figuration of the birangona as a horrific sublime also brings to the surface Lyotard's formulation of the encoding' - the underlying moral values and judgment - that are implicit in the feelings that enable the readability of the war-heroine. I interrogate these hegemonic affective aesthetics (the way wartime rape is often narrowly described) through a nuanced ethnographic account of the birangona's life trajectory. This less categorised, non-semiotic figuration of the birangona is the interventionary mode, the politics - in Ranciere's formulation - through which this idea of the horrific sublime can be disrupted.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200003

The MACBA, Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona, played a key role in promoting direct action as one of the Fine Arts'. Ranciere's theories of the politics of aesthetics have been very influential at the MACBA. Describing different events of political conflict around the MACBA in the recent past, this article investigates the contradictions in the relation between art, activism and the politics of aesthetics in Barcelona, and advances a critique of the limits of Ranciere's notion of politics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200006

This visual essay foregrounds the changing role of the author's own artistic practice conceived both as eye witness and facilitator in this context. The essay also explores how anthropological tools and museum techniques are employed to draw audiences into the aesthetics of individual pain connected to experiences of loss and displacement in conflict situations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000365586200005	
J	Arregui, Anibal								Amazonian quilombolas and the technopolitics of aluminum								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	3			249	272		10.1177/1359183515578937			SEP 2015	2015	By drawing on field research, this article suggests that the impact of an aluminum mine on its neighboring quilombola communities can be analyzed from at least two interconnected technopolitical scales. The first relates to the anatomo-political discipline that the mine imposes over the body of its workers as well as to its inhibiting effect on the traditional body techniques of the populations that surround it. The second stresses a mine's ecological governmentality that naturalizes the Amazonian environment and downplays quilombola sociotechnical infrastructures. The term technopolitics is proposed as a critical reading on biopolitics that ethnographically highlights the connection between the individual body and the environment as example of the entanglement of the bios (political, qualified life) and a technologically affected zoe, or bare life.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000360830400001

Although apparently an ordinary cooking fuel, the author argues that this briquette is a perfect object for exploring the unfolding and experiences of Doi moi, the economic and social reform processes launched in 1986. The author takes a biographical approach as she traces the beehive coal briquette from its birth to its rise and demise as a cooking fuel in Vietnam. Along the way, the article explores the diverse interactions and relations between objects, humans and nature, and their unequal outcomes. The example of the beehive coal briquette shows how everyday things not only reflect social change and vice-versa but can also produce change.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000360830400005

It also considers the role of carnations in discussions and depictions of gardens in a popular medieval Italian estate creation and management book, Piero Crescenzi's Ruralium Commodorum, that, especially in French translation in Netherlandish illuminated manuscript copies, was a how-to-do-it manual for those seeking to build manor and town houses with gardens befitting their status. Thus, both depictions of the potted plant in art and scenes of the carnation in a garden setting were intended to project the owners' flower connoisseurship and their splendor and civic magnificence. Further, the makers (in most cases artisan fellow townsmen of the commissioners) of these miniatures and borders projected for the books' patrons luxury and consumption fantasies on which to model their lives, and to help them distinguish themselves culturally from the long established landed aristocracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000360830400002

The author seeks to understand what Adorno calls the constellation' between people and mahogany by tracing human-nature relations through the global commodity chain focusing on one particular artefact, the Gibson Les Paul, an iconic solid wood electric guitar made primarily of mahogany grown in Mexico and Fiji. Enviromateriality considers three phases in which to examine the material and materiality in a variety of processes that are interconnected. These phases allow for an examination of local community relations with mahogany as trees and products, and whether certified mahogany helps create sustainability and social justice. The author also examines guitar players' relations with their mahogany guitars, particularly focusing on the aesthetics that make the Les Paul desired, as well as the sonic and tonal agentic force that they consider mahogany to have.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000360830400004	
J	Roth, Solen								Argillite, faux-argillite and black plastic: The political economy of simulating a quintessential Haida substance								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	3			299	312		10.1177/1359183515581631			SEP 2015	2015	Hlgas7agaa or argillite is a type of carbonaceous shale that is found on Slatechuck Mountain, in Haida Gwaii. Since the 19th century, the Haida have been producing argillite carvings for sale, including small-scale totem poles. Argillite carvings are now a much revered art form, and the Haida remain the only ones to have direct access to this stone. However, various companies produce imitations of argillite carving in composite materials, with more or less success in producing the look' and feel' of argillite. All these imitations, including those that are nowhere near achieving convincing simulation, acquire an added commercial appeal that distinguishes them from plastic totem poles' by evoking a symbolically, socially, economically, and culturally valued material. Arguably, this makes producers of argillite-like items indebted to those who have made argillite so valuable by carefully guarding it from outside circulation in raw form, namely the Haida.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000360830400003

Specifically, the attempt is to investigate the multiplicities of vibrancy by considering one of Mussolini's bunkers. The author examines the location of the bunker in the EUR (Esposizione Universale Romana) neighbourhood in Rome, the bunker's materiality, and the context and social meaning of the bunker through a contemporary art exhibition called Confronti' (Confrontations) that took place in the bunker in 2009. The article argues that while emphasizing matter's inherent vibrancy may be useful in some cases, there is also merit in further unpacking the ways in which vibrancy is produced. In this example, the concrete bunker expresses vibrancy through the processes involved in the emergent material form, and in the sustained politics and social considerations embedded in valuing tangible urban heritage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000005

Items such as bone crosses and harps reveal the tensions inherent in discourses of religious identity and cultural nationalism, while the reworking of prison-issue objects illustrates how a sense of personal agency was maintained in a profoundly disempowering context. Macrame handbags and children's reins gave internees a continued sense of involvement in and control over their homes and relationships, while mantle borders, tea cosies and table centres conjured idealised notions of domesticity. Fundamentally, the creation of such objects allowed prisoners to engage with the troubling and often contradictory experiences of masculinity that lay at the heart of camp life.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000003

In most scholarly studies of ritual, analyses of the material setting are avoided in favour of a focus on symbolic expression, cultural representations, or embodied cognition. Here a close look at the interplay between substances, sounds, smells, elementary actions on matter and supernatural forces shows that there is a blending phenomenon between myth, rite and technique at the early stages of the preparatory phases as well as during the ritual action itself. The central part played by technical actions and interaction with matter in the ritual of Samoan tattooing is a case study for a technological approach to ritual efficacy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000001

With a focus on both historical and contemporary sites, from the Neolithic long barrow of Wayland's Smithy, Oxfordshire, to the plethora of wishing-wells and coin-trees distributed across the British Isles, it demonstrates the popularity of coins as ritual deposits. The author considers how they are perceived and treated by site custodians, and concludes with a case study of an archaeological excavation, the 2013 Ardmaddy Wishing-Tree Project, which recovered a large amount of contemporary coin deposits. This article does not aim to locate itself within the debates of site custodianship and accessibility, nor does it propose to address the broader dilemmas of a site's ritual continuity or resurgence. Instead, its aim is to encourage archaeologists to consider the contemporary deposit as an integral part of the ritual narrative of a site, rather than as disposable ritual litter'.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000004	
J	Marsh, Diana E.								Reassembling the social life of a Medicine Man: Reassessing otherness, agency and authorship in the Wellcome archives								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				20	2			211	245		10.1177/1359183515578977			JUN 2015	2015	This article traces the social life of a Medicine Man in a life-size diorama at the London Science Museum. While the author shows that the representations the model has perpetuated throughout its social life, largely due to its particular material and social contexts, were often laden with misperception and exoticization, she also argues that the model came to be on contemporary view through an unusual set of actions, spaces, and happenings which, first, question the notion of curatorial authorship, and second, expand the growing body of work that considers the wide-ranging kinds of networks and agencies that shape the life histories of things. She begins by describing the context for the model, including its relationship to colonial histories of display and more recent work on agency and technologies of representation. Next, she describes the model's early life in the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and its relationship to early ethnography in Ibibioland and London. Then, she describes its shifts in representation amidst changes to the network of associated objects, spaces, events and persons that made up its representational framework over a 30-year period, before recounting its most recent move to the Science Museum in the late 1970s. Thus detailing this model's social life, the article illustrates the ways in which authorship, colonial relationships, and representation emerge as complex and distributed amidst networks of material and social contexts. The author therefore argues for a particularist (rather than broad discursive) approach to tracing the associations and networks by which displays come to exist in museum spaces and become embedded with complex histories of colonial involvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000354773000006

Bobbling is considered an index of a faulty or decaying materiality, and an index of usage and, possibly, carelessness and hardship. It limits an individual's ability to project a desired self. It hints at an individual's inability to present a renewed self. It not only disrupts a common process of value creation through the act of dressing, but also exposes a disputed process of value creation through the consumption of certain objects. It foregrounds a predisposition to equate the value of objects with the value of people. It affects a sense of self-worth. The author demonstrates that a preoccupation with bobbling reflects deeper concerns and frequent deliberations over value in postsocialist Romania.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000350156100001

In a broader perspective, understanding the complex social roles of Aboriginal technology and material culture in recent history helps to redefine contemporary conceptions of Aboriginal healing and well-being as material, bodily and ideological phenomena, in which technology and material culture have become a cultural heritage essential for their well-being.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000350156100005

In the Nigerian city of Jos, the unpredictable availability of power, fuel, water, etc. becomes a vehicle of meaning. In many settings across the globe, infrastructure is often made invisible, and the centre stage that it takes in everyday life remains unrecognized. In Jos, however, as in many African cities, the constant need to predict its flows contradicts the prefix infra (below); rather than being hidden beneath the realm of experience it is brought to the surface as a puzzle to be figured out. These explorations in turn come to reveal matters beyond the infrastructure itself. Just as diviners infer the state of the world from the stones they have thrown, reading significance out of the seeming randomness of matter, the infrastructure turns intricate questions into tangible clues. It becomes a suprastructure - a divination tool giving clues about the past, present and future of the Nigerian nation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000350156100003	
J	De Nardi, Sarah								An embodied approach to Second World War storytelling mementoes: Probing beyond the archival into the corporeality of memories of the resistance								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	4			443	464		10.1177/1359183514554987			DEC 2014	2014	What happens when we include materiality and corporeality into an exploration of the Second World War resistance experience? Although an understanding of veteran storytelling as feeling' and sharing of emotional memories may appear obvious in the context of a human experience like resistance, academic literature on the topic is rare. When war mementoes are considered in the context of oral sources, they are at best conceptualized as archival items, museum pieces, or memory aids. However, semi-structured interviews with Italian and British resistance activists suggest that their experience was grounded in the body and the world, and is shared through storytelling that is also perforce grounded in the body. This article explores the worlds of feelings' of veterans through their interaction with mementoes used in storytelling, and contends that these objects constitute not only sites of memory or relics, but also sites of feeling. Implicating the bodily sphere into a hitherto predominantly military narrative produces a more holistic and bottom-up understanding of conflict experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000345342400005

Instead, this article argues that a focus on the material traces of consumer goods circulating in colonial and post-colonial markets, and in expert knowledge that shaped bodily practices, domestic habits, and rural landscapes over time, yields a more nuanced picture of Chinese-African entanglements. We examine elements of Chineseness that inform Sierra Leonean ways of dwelling - particularly of farming rice, and of intervening therapeutically on bodies - but often through intermediaries whose imprints mask Asian origins. Contemporary China-Africa friendship rhetoric stresses bilateralism and palimpsestic reinscriptions of earlier relations, but belies a history in which multiple Chinas struggled for global recognition through partnerships with African countries that articulated with colonial mediations and Cold War alliances.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000345342400002	
J	Kendall, Laurel; Yang, Jongsung								Goddess with a Picasso face: Art markets, collectors and sacred things in the circulation of Korean shaman paintings								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	4			401	423		10.1177/1359183514551119			DEC 2014	2014	In the well-known story of how primitive art' came to be recognized as such, things once regarded as sacred or empowered circulate as art collected for reasons far removed from their original intention. In the case of Korean shaman paintings, the authors interpret this process as a kind of purification' in Bruno Latour's sense, a translation and transformation of old practices (paintings as the seats of gods) into things that are deployed in acceptably modern ways (paintings as art commodities). The authors recognize, also following Latour, that this is necessarily an incomplete and unstable process. Their discussion assumes two parallel purifications, a discursive purification that recuperates the paintings as art market commodities and a more literal purification by shamans when, in particular circumstances, they deem it appropriate to release paintings to the art market. The authors are concerned with both thickening and broadening the discussion of art market circulation: thickening, by showing how, within a particular history in a particular place, at some distance from Paris or New York, things once sacred came to be revalued as art'. They broaden the discussion by setting it among collectors and dealers in South Korea and thus outside the familiar dichotomy of the West and the rest that has heretofore organized discussions of the commodification and circulation of once sacred goods. A seemingly familiar story about art markets and the social life of things unfolds within the unfamiliar context of an alternative or Other modernity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000345342400003

They show that the identity of these farmers is created and maintained through competing systems of tillage and the ideologies that support them, which also shape the agricultural landscape. Specifically, they compare conservation tillage wedded to modern' ideologies of scientific farming with conventional tillage newly linked to beliefs about both organic and traditional farming, and examine how farmers use these different forms of tillage to create their identities. Roadside farming, recognition and denunciation of other farmers' practices, and recognition and justification of their own contribute to identity formation. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion of how identity is formed through day-to-day activities in the material world. The plow creates divisions in the High Plains community between organic farmers who continue to rely on this implement in their material engagement with the land and the chemical farmers who distance their practices from the plow as they distinguish themselves as stewards of the soil.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000345342400001

Through the study of the location of graves, architecture, and offerings, the authors explore the type of personhood that Calchaqui communities built and represented through the materiality of funerary practice. They claim that in this cultural and historical context, death became a realm in which relatedness was interwoven. Death, symbolically and materially, built bridges, connecting and entangling people with place and with each other. The funerary sphere was not strategically used to celebrate particular biographies and personal accomplishments, but rather it was another realm, like daily life, where individual identity dissolved into place and into the collective.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000343637700004	
J	Copertino, Domenico								The tools of the trade: The materiality of architecture in the patrimonialization of 'Arab houses' in Damascus								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	3			327	351		10.1177/1359183514540068			SEP 2014	2014	The ethnographic study of architecture shows that building and restoring practices play an active part in the construction of the social groups that carry them out. 'Proper' practices and concepts of heritage distinguish 'authentic' from 'inauthentic' inhabitants of Damascus Old Town. Heritage development is therefore an act of culturally meaningful engagement through which an arena for confrontation and argument about the 'production of the space' is constituted. Focusing on the dynamic interrelationship of material, social and symbolic aspects of architecture, the author examines the agency and materiality of Arab houses as objects in a mutual relationship with people who build, restore, buy, sell and dwell in them. Getting involved in the material activities and engaging in relationships between the different social actors in this arena allows the intrusive ethnographic glance to grasp the cultural meaning of architecture, not simply as a symbolic representation of people who own, build and restore houses, but as a constitutive element of their sense of identity, belonging and distinction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000343637700005	
J	Ferret, Carole								Towards an anthropology of action: From pastoral techniques to modes of action								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	3			279	302		10.1177/1359183514540065			SEP 2014	2014	This article starts from the hypothesis that societies are characterized by their propensity towards certain forms of action forms that differ in their means, rather than their ends. It then proceeds to develop a theoretical framework for understanding the different dimensions or aspects of human action: manipulation/operation; passive/active/interventionist; endogenous/exogenous/participative; direct/indirect; positive/negative/contrary; internal/external; continuous/discontinuous. This framework is the product of extensive research on pastoral techniques among Siberian Yakuts, but can also be applied to actions carried out in other spheres that concern behaviour towards nature and towards other people. In so doing, the article strives to resolve certain key problems within the anthropology of action.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000343637700003	
J	Weismantel, Mary; Meskell, Lynn								Substances: 'Following the Material' through two prehistoric cases								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	3			233	251		10.1177/1359183514546803			SEP 2014	2014	In this article, we argue for a multi-dimensional research strategy incorporating material, social and phenomenological analysis in the study of figurines and other human effigies. We call this approach 'following the material'. To illustrate, we examine two case studies: figurines from the Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk (Turkey) and human effigies from the Formative region of Moche (Peru). We look first at the material substances from which artifacts are made and the material contexts in which they were produced, circulated and deposited, before turning to analysis of the representation of the body. This enables us to see these objects as themselves bodies - not merely imperfect replicas of actual humans, but material objects made of substances that afford particular kinds of interactions between fleshly and artifactual bodies: This focus on the materiality of artifacts reveals tight connections between objects in human form, material culture, environment, landscape, and political economy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000343637700001	
J	Allen, Stewart								An award controversy: Anthropology, architecture, and the robustness of knowledge								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	2			169	184		10.1177/1359183514522121			JUN 2014	2014	Despite the universal presence of architectural forms in human societies, architecture, as a serious topic of anthropological enquiry, has been somewhat overlooked by the discipline as a whole. This article draws upon an anthropology of architecture as process' to explore the controversy involved in a disputed architectural award presented to a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Rajasthan, India. The author follows the manner in which the actors involved in the controversy define and construct the situation, in the process bringing to light normally overlooked aspects of development and architecture. In this conceptualisation, the built form is imagined as neither exclusively social nor material but rather processual, in which the currents and paths of myriad relationships turn static constructions into complex spaces of conflict and negotiation. The article concludes that only by paying attention to the material forms of such processes can we account for how certain narratives triumph over others.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200004

Its central question is where brokers mediate between different worlds and with what material artifacts. The author presents the case of community leaders in a favela in Recife, Brazil, who operate at the boundary between different worlds separated by class, race and place. Their offices, with their material artifacts, form brokerage spaces. He introduces these offices as boundary places: privileged spatial and material contexts in which worlds that would be incompatible in other circumstances become temporarily compatible. Simultaneously, in these boundary places, the differences between these worlds are reproduced. Through an in-depth analysis, he shows how brokers' practices take place' in the spatiality and materiality of their offices, which become a stage for both the convergence and divergence of different worlds.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200002

This article explores how Turkish people in Vienna constitute, perform and enunciate belongings through practices and discourses around travelling forms and spaces of material culture. Underpinned by an ethnography founded on a repertoire of Turkish objects in Vienna, this article addresses the relational constitution of a particular taste and a diasporic belonging within a specific context of displacement and relocation of both people and material objects. Taste diaspora' refers to a certain diasporic sphere that is formed through a collective taste in material objects and enunciated in the aesthetics of the everyday.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200005

The desire to develop Hinemihi, the historic Maori meeting house at Clandon Park, as a functioning marae (ceremonial gathering place) has provided a challenge to conventional heritage conservation practice. A response to the conservation of Hinemihi has been to adapt practices developed by the Pouhere Taonga / New Zealand Historic Places Trust for the conservation of historic marae. The success of this approach relies on the formation of an active and sustainable marae community. Therefore, a series of community-based events have been delivered to nurture the developing relationships between Hinemihi and her people as an essential element of the conservation project. This has questioned the central role of Maori in the long-term care of Hinemihi. As a result, the formation of Hinemihi's People' is an attempt to develop a sustainable conservation community for Hinemihi at Clandon Park that reflects a spatially and temporally grounded reality, based on lived experiences.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200006

Street mirrors were introduced to coastal towns in Sweden and Finland in the 18th and early 19th centuries and may still be found in well-preserved towns with historic wooden centres. The authors argue that the introduction of monitoring and spying devices, such as street mirrors, occurred in the 18th century due to increased urban populations and feelings of insecurity caused by greater regional and transnational mobility. Mirrors, in this sense, were one material mechanism in the process of modernization and the development of individuality.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000342828200003	
J	Felker, Fiona M.; Hammond, Joyce D.; Schaaf, Gregory; Stevenson, Joan C.								Existential and object authenticity in Southwestern pottery: Intertwined and complementary								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	1			93	110		10.1177/1359183513503255			MAR 2014	2014	A much discussed concept, authenticity is still very important to collectors and museums in 2013 with respect to Native American art, but few have examined the dynamic between artist and buyer in relation to how concepts of authenticity affect the exchange. Useful here is a constructivist approach that examines authenticity with respect to local perceptions, values and setting. Existential authenticity is revealed through statements by the potters of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso Pueblos, New Mexico, and object authenticity is derived from attributes of the pot and potter partly from online advertisements for 571 pots. The proxies for existential values predict 39 per cent of the cash value of the pot. Ongoing discussions among all the stakeholders preceding juried competitions conserve potters' values and support artist agency. These values, as expressed in the pottery, are likely part of buyers' attraction to the pottery.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000329919700006

This article furthers this hypothesis by undertaking a close examination of Desh Chintan, a rich nationalist image from the 1930s. Grounding Desh Chintan against a matrix of archival sources, banned literature, oral history interviews and other posters of the era presents a substantially different picture of the way in which the anti-colonial movement was conceived in the 1930s. This analysis suggests that there was a moment in the freedom struggle in which support for acts of retributive revolutionary violence were unproblematically maintained alongside genuine enthusiasm for the Gandhian program of non-violence.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000329919700002	
J	Nugent, Maria								Shellwork on show: Colonial history, Australian Aboriginal women and the display of decorative objects								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				19	1			75	92		10.1177/1359183513509535			MAR 2014	2014	This article explores the exhibition history of decorative shell-art objects made by Aboriginal women in southeast Australia since the late Victorian era. Although produced for over a century, Aboriginal women's shellwork' (as it is known) has only recently received sustained curatorial attention. During the last few decades it has been acquired by private and public collectors and exhibited in both small independent and major public art galleries and museums. The article uses the contemporary curatorial interest in Aboriginal women's shellwork as an occasion to trace a longer history of its exhibition and display. A historical view reveals the cultural', aesthetic' and political' work that these objects performed as they were displayed in ways designed to communicate messages about their makers and to mediate social relations under colonial conditions. Earlier histories of display and its rhetorical functions are often lost, ignored or downplayed when Aboriginal women's shellwork is exhibited within contemporary exhibition spaces; but the author suggests that there is more continuity between old and new display cultures and practices than is generally acknowledged. In light of this, the article argues for greater recognition of earlier histories of display practices and visual rhetorics to inform the contemporary interpretation and exhibition of these objects. The article concludes with a recent installation of Aboriginal women's shellwork that is suggestive of this approach.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000329919700005

The transformation of cloth, both within ceremonial contexts, and perhaps more significantly beyond them, has been all but overlooked. This article explores the innovative ways Tlingit women used cloth and considers the ways in which it participated in the construction of new social circumstances and also masked longstanding cultural practices as it circulated within and between Tlingit and Euro-American settler communities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In particular, the author looks at how calico cloth was utilized in relation to the burgeoning tourist industry in Southeast Alaska and the annual berry feast.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000329919700004

Themes of connection and agency relating to these materials were invoked in the process. The complex social biographies of some objects mean they are at times discussed as having agency, or interpreted as being culturally perceived as such. In the case detailed here, the affect expressed in responses to a variety of objects indicates different interpretations. The discussion therefore considers the logic of connection expressed in Aboriginal ontologies to argue against ideas of the agency of objects. It is instead suggested that the meaning invested in them is related more to their material qualities and the contexts in which they are perceived. This consideration is grounded in a discussion of a collaborative project between researchers and Aboriginal people in which these matters arose.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000327547900002

Kept in the main world museums and collected by private individuals, molakana have become famous worldwide. Studies of molakana have mainly focused on their significance as an index of Kuna identity or as wealth repositories linked to forms of female handicrafts. This article looks at the everyday dimensions of mola as part of the Kuna female wardrobe, and examines the overlooked aspect of their life cycle in relation to the wider domain of Kuna sociality. The attention is on the experiential values of molakana and on the ways in which they materialize relations and the aesthetics of Kuna sociality. The ethos of social life unfolds by means of the specific material practices through which molakana and social relations are sewn together.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000327547900004

The author demonstrates how different articulations of the art object' emerge as unfolding epistemic objects through which actors work to manage their working relationships and the uncertainties and risks that transpire during the exhibition development process from tackling notions of difference'. She argues that these competing material and performative configurations of the art object' shape contingent forms of action, knowledge and agency, and are aligned to, and resourceful for, professional practices, identity and expertise. These configurations influence how difference' is addressed and managed as part of cultural diversity' initiatives in the art museum.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000327547900005

Forensic activity is a cool, slow and deliberate process of making meaning. But what of the feelings that also suffuse the scenes and the evidence? Does the force of affect linger in or around forensic materials? Can these feelings be evoked so they can be assayed to produce a particular kind of knowledge, even as they pulse and pass? How can investigators pay proper attention to the feelings that often elude or bamboozle conventional semiotic and semantic procedures? To address these questions, this article considers a specific archive of crime-scene photographs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000323896500003

In an effort to understand the formation and longevity of these three longstanding stereotypes this article submits that the material properties of fat - particularly its unctuousness, softness, and insensateness - have played important roles in motivating some of the responses this substance has generated both with reference to human bodies and their material worlds. Due to the conceptual slipperiness of fat' in its various forms (whether frozen' as a solid or liquefied as oil or grease), this analysis uses examples from ancient Greek, Roman and Hebrew texts to track the ways in which this substance has been perceived across these registers, revealing the surprisingly mercurial and ambiguous ways in which fat' has been understood culturally.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000320499800003

In its original context, Pedal to the Meddle was conceptualized and created to critique museum practices, the politics of ownership and First Nations' dispossession on the Northwest Coast. However, when this artwork was dislocated from its site of origin and re-curated in other exhibitionary spaces, its indigenized critique, relational aesthetics and locational meanings were inevitably altered. It is these retellings, through the artist's practice, different spaces, material configurations, collaborative processes and curatorial voices that constitute the subject of this article.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000320499800001

The meanings of red envelopes: Promises and lies at a Singaporean Chinese funeral								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				18	2			155	169		10.1177/1359183513483909			JUN 2013	2013	This article begins with a puzzle. Why do red envelopes appear at Singaporean Chinese funerals? Specifically, why are payments to corpse-handlers, coffin-carriers and gravediggers wrapped in red, when the work they do is described as being white through and through'? Conventionally, red is the colour of auspicious occasions, hence it is the colour of a traditional wedding dress, while white is the colour of death, of the shroud and of mourning wreaths. In this article, the author suggests that the meanings of colours might actually be more complex than previous scholarship has suggested. By following this exchange of red envelopes, paying careful attention to the shifting meanings given to red, she reveals the complex, otherwise unarticulated, nature of the relationships made visible via their transfer. She follows Keane's suggestion that attaching meaning to material takes considerable social work in order to clarify the meanings an object in exchange should carry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000320499800004

Although a great number of scholars have explored these changes, explanations have typically been sought in mimetic performances of Western gender relationships among native communities and hegemonic restructuring of attitudes by outside agents. Material objects, however, were perhaps as powerful as human agents in driving these ideological shifts because they are capable of representing layers of cultural values even when actors are absent. By examining material objects as active social actors during focused social interactions, this article describes one of the many avenues by which new Euro-American attitudes were slowly introduced to the rhythms of Pawnee life.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000317865400003

Indeed, such themes have long troubled many postcolonial intellectuals and been the subject of intense debates. Shanghai Expo 2010 brought this issue into focus once again, an event where national identities were performed to an audience of 73 million. This article examines the objects and architecture of cultural nationalism in relation to questions of sovereignty and enduring colonialities for a number of Asian and African countries participating in previous world's fairs and at Shanghai. It draws on the ideas of Partha Chatterjee to interpret why they embraced a language of tradition and heritage, reproducing the same geo-cultural hierarchies familiar to the age of European empire. The author argues that, within the cultural economies of globalization today, such countries engage in a form of auto-exoticism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000317865400004

J	Rosner, Daniela K.; Taylor, Alex S.								Binding and aging								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				17	4			405	424		10.1177/1359183512459630			DEC 2012	2012	In many respects, we take the age of things for granted. Age is assumed to be an inherent quality, dictated by the time a thing has been in existence and put to use. Many of us have even developed an appreciation for the wear associated with age. The worn leather covers of old books, their mottled pages and the creases along their spines are all considered, in some circles at least, to be signs of age and thus value. This article examines such ideas of age through the practices of restoration bookbinding. First and foremost, it illustrates how age can be something produced through the interleaving of both social and material practices. Age is seen here not as an intangible, definite attribute. Rather, it is something actively worked on; it is co-produced through an ongoing relationship between materials, craftsmen and the world they work in. The article focuses, specifically, on the craft of restoration binding. From 200-year-old antique books to the most mundane paperbacks, restoration binding requires that manual skills and aesthetic sensitivity be distributed between the binders, the materials and tools of the trade. However, notions of age have changed over the years and these, we hope to show, are tightly interwoven with the social and material practices that make up restoration bookbinding.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000311695800005

In particular, the article intends to critically extend the notion of appropriation by introducing 'overlay' as a new concept to analytically grasp the uneven cultural traffic from the indigenous artisans to the designers and the majority society at large. It is argued that in this process the 'meaning' of the original Guarani designs is suspended and ultimately short-circuited, as it is no longer available either to the Guarani, who do not consume the final products, or to the customers, who are not provided with any information on the meaning of the patterns. However, the article does not insist on a presumed 'loss of meaning' for these objects. Rather, the article foregrounds notions of materiality, creativity and innovation in relation to the specific economic and working relations between Mbya Guarani artisans and designers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835	1460-3586		WOS:000311695800002

By revealing how Tibetan carpets became valuable in contemporary Lhasa, this article contributes to an emerging literature that critically examines the roles played by ethnic art producers themselves in the politics of value. Further, this article contributes to the Tibetan Cultural Studies literature by tracing the continuities and changes in the Lhasa carpet industry from the early 20th century to the early 21st century. The author's analysis focuses on three chains of events: (1) the establishment of a carpet workshop by the Tibetan Government; (2) the formation of the first socialist carpet factory; and (3) the entry of international business ventures into the Lhasa carpet industry. She discusses the forms and scale of the struggles over the making of 'valuable' carpets, the roles played by Tibetan officials and overseas businessmen in the politics of value under different political-economic regimes, and the ways in which such politics not only presented challenges for Tibetan artisans, but also offered opportunities for empowerment.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000304883600005

Such has been the case for the Museo degli Usi e Costumi della Gente Trentina, founded in 1968 by the ethnographer Giuseppe Sebesta, and based in the vicinity of Cole and Wolf's celebrated and much contended 'hidden frontier' between Germanic and Romance worlds in the Italian Alps. Yet local identity is often elusive and easily eschews immediate reduction to material embodiments, as the intricacies of museum politics in the context of the local dialectics of cultural identification demonstrate.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000304883200007	
J	Malkogeorgou, Titika								Folding, stitching, turning: putting conservation into perspective								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	4	SI		441	455		10.1177/1359183511424829			DEC 2011	2011	The Victoria & Albert Museum marked a turning point in museum policy in Britain in conceiving the modern museum as an instrument of modern education. Through its cultural programme based on education and the relationship between objects and people, the V&A was established as an applied and decorative arts museum. As a source of object-specific knowledge, it has constructed a comprehensive canon around applied arts and their makers, shaped almost exclusively in its own context. In museum practice, conservation is part of the construction and transmission of knowledge through a distinctive relationship to objects and choices made in the studio, guided by a set of ethical values and a hands-on approach. This article follows the conservation of an 18th-century mantua (a 17th-18th-century court dress) for display in the V&A galleries and offers an insight into a process of continuous conflict between the uncovering and reconstruction of truth that takes place in the conservation studio, and the relationship to the object's biography in tracing its original form. The author also examines the preservation of cultural material as a way of materializing the self and contextualizing social activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000304883200008

J	Poulter, Emma K.								The real thing? Souvenir objects in the West African collections at the Manchester Museum								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	3			265	284		10.1177/1359183511413525			SEP 2011	2011	The significance of the 'souvenir object' has been the subject of increasing scholarly interest since Nelson HH Graburn's seminal work on tourist art, published in 1976. The production of the souvenir has been shown to be shaped by expectations and desires on the part of both the consumer and the producer, with the form of the souvenir object embodying these negotiated meanings. In this article, the author examines how the production of 'made-for-sale' objects shaped networks of meaning, understanding and memory within and between the locales of West Africa and the north-west of England during the 20th century. She considers how the demand for objects, set in motion by Europeans visiting, living or working in West Africa at this time, is reflected through the West African collections at the Manchester Museum. Via a series of case studies looking at functional as well as non-functional souvenir objects in the collection, she examines the biographies of made-for-sale objects and the traces of memory they manifest. In so doing, she adds to the body of research recontextualizing souvenir objects in museum collections.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000304882700003

J	Wengrow, David								Cognition, materiality and monsters: the cultural transmission of counter-intuitive forms in Bronze Age societies								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				16	2			131	149		10.1177/1359183511402276			JUN 2011	2011	In seeking to explain why some cultural traits are more 'catching' than others, evolutionary anthropologists have invoked the influence of cognitive constraints on the transmission of culture. Pascal Boyer's explanation of the global popularity of religious beliefs in terms of their psychologically 'counter-intuitive' nature is a strong example. Drawing upon archaeological evidence from early civilizations, this article argues that such an approach does not in fact account satisfactorily for the observable distribution of a central type of counter-intuitive representation: that of the composite figure, or 'monster'. A surprising feature of that distribution is the scarcity of composite figures in prehistoric art, prior to the Urban Revolution of the 4th millennium BC, after which their spread follows a highly patterned and selective (rather than 'contagious') trajectory of expansion. In interpreting this patterned spread of counter-intuitive forms, technological and institutional factors are brought into account alongside cognitive ones, with wider methodological implications for evolutionary approaches to the transmission of culture.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000304882500002

This 'retracing' has revealed a set of alternative associations that the feathered rope has had: with other museum objects and written documents, as well as with a range of people. Although presented in the museum as a 'matter of fact', its original function is revealed to have been a 'matter of concern', enabling this 'object' to emerge from its glass case as a 'thing' (Latour). Retracing its network and the historical process by which it became a museum object has meant engaging with the scientific ambitions of E.B. Tylor and his notions of independent corroborating evidence, as well as with the more 'folkloric' practices of literary folklore.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000281678800003

Focusing on the social and intellectual contexts of these shifts and their reception by museum-goers and reviewers, this article looks at the process by which natural history museums capture, discipline and display natural objects. The article builds on the premise that natural history museums and exhibitions exist, in part, to teach people how they should look at and think about nature. The author draws on Arturo Escobar's idea of 'regimes of nature' to examine how shifts in exhibitionary practices manifest shifting understandings of nature in the United States. From 1876 to 1997, she identifies four different nature regimes represented in the Smithsonian mineral exhibits. These regimes propose different articulations between nature, the nation-state, US capital and the museum-going public and the author labels them 'nature as resource', 'nature as order', 'nature as spectacle' and 'nature as fine art'.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000275846300002	
J	Larson, Frances								THE THINGS ABOUT HENRY WELLCOME								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	1			83	104		10.1177/13591835010355225			MAR 2010	2010	This article explores the material legacy of Henry Wellcome (1853-1936). Wellcome worked closely with objects throughout his life, both as a businessman and as a collector. These objects have biographical significance. In his relationships with things, Wellcome was drawn to the miniature and the gigantic. As a founding partner of the pharmaceuticals firm Burroughs Wellcome and Company, he designed 'compressed medicines' that were valued for their convenience and small size. They embody Wellcome's methodical, perfectionist nature. But, as a museum collector, he created a collection that was so enormous it became unmanageable and was left unfinished. This article seeks to reconcile these two aspects of Wellcome's interactions with things, and argues that Wellcome's professional work manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a miniature scale sheds light on his actions as a collector who created a truly gigantic assemblage of artefacts.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000275846300004	
J	Wilkinson-Weber, Clare M.								FROM COMMODITY TO COSTUME Productive Consumption in the Making of Bollywood Film Looks								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				15	1			3	29		10.1177/1359183510355227			MAR 2010	2010	As scholarly interest in consumption has risen, little attention has been paid to productive consumption, or the acquisition and use of commodities within production processes. Since the shift toward neo-liberal economic policies in India in the early 1990s, commoditized, branded clothing has multiplied in the marketplace, and is increasingly featured in films. Selecting and inserting these clothes into film costume production draws on some of the same discriminations that producers employ in their guise as consumers. Dress designers' fluency with brands and fashion solidifies their professional standing but costume production is a field of social practice that includes many actors who do not share the same dispositions toward consumption as designers. This leads to professional differentiation in the field that can be tied to proficiency in consumption practices. Commodities may be just as effective as indices of differentiation in production as they are in the more familiar domain of consumption.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000275846300001	
J	Hurn, Samantha								THE 'CARDINAUTS' OF THE WESTERN COAST OF WALES Exchanging and Exhibiting Horses in the Pursuit of Fame								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				13	3			335	355		10.1177/1359183508095499			NOV 2008	2008	This article is concerned with considering non-human animals as examples of inalienable material culture. The non-human animals in question are the horses indigenous to a particular area of West Wales in the UK, where they have been selectively bred for centuries. The purpose of this breeding programme initially was to ensure that they were able to negotiate the obstacles presented by the local landscape, thereby providing a lifeline to the people living on isolated farms and smallholdings in the area. However, now that horses are no longer integral to agricultural production, their selective breeding is continued to achieve different ends - the fame of their human owners who engage in a form of ceremonial exchange reminiscent of the Trobriand kula. Traditionally, kula participants travelled to neighbouring islands to exchange shell items which were, according to Malinowski 'possessed for the sake of possession itself, and the ownership of them with the ensuing renown... the main source of their value' (1922: 89). As Leip (2001) notes when comparing bird watching in contemporary Sweden to the kula, the two practices are not directly comparable. Nonetheless, comparison is rewarding with regard to the motivations of the players involved. Such a position will form the basis of the discussion.									0	0		0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000260339700005

In this essay, I bring artist and photography scholar Deborah Willis's use of Jones's concept of reterritorialization to bear on Whispers from the Walls, an installation that Whitfield Lovell created at the University of North Texas Art Gallery in 1999. Chiefly, I explore what kinds and whose histories Whispers from the Walls engaged. In particular, I emphasize contributions that the photographs Lovell studied to create the installation and the objects he included therein made to recovering histories.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000225270800001	
J	Grodzins, A								Vanishing - Seeds' cyclicality								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				8	3			255	272					NOV 2003	2003	To take seeds in South Asia as vanishing objects unites concerns with embodied but equally ineffable religious meanings; with globalized debates over agricultural technology; and with grass roots movements to regenerate sustainable traditions. Using a devotional text recorded at a funeral wake in Rajasthan in 1980, I evoke a world in which reproductive cyclicality is the signal attribute of vanishing. At stake in the briefly incandescent but already obsolete furor over so-called 'terminator' or 'suicide' seeds is cyclicality's replacement by permanent loss. With excerpts from both mass-media articles and activists' reporting, I explore the ways corporate greed is perceived and portrayed as a kind of hypervandalism practiced on tradition. Finally, I consider an image - sprouting seeds - that suggests the opposite of vanishing. Aware of the pitfalls of nostalgia and romanticization, I nevertheless conclude with this germinal wish to highlight seed-saving and propagation practices that - even in the era of modern hyperecologies - allow cyclicality to prevail over termination.

J	De Lorenzo, C								Appropriating anthropology? Document and rhetoric								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				5	1			91	113					MAR 2000	2000	The use of Copyright Registers by photographers and other artists provides a useful barometer of cultural assumptions over the period from the 1870s to the 1950s. This paper will explore images that both appropriate and subvert anthropological claims about Aboriginality. It is possible to demonstrate that whilst the held appears to require an engagement with anthropologically-derived visual constructions of 'authenticity' and 'Aboriginality', commercial photographers used this anchoring as a base from which to project diverse and contested claims of Aboriginality. I will argue, however, that commercial photographers did not so much diminish or contaminate an anthropological paradigm as extend a rhetorical activity of inventing and reinventing authenticity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000085507100005

J	Bundgaard, H								Contending Indian art worlds								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	3			321	337					NOV 1999	1999	This article argues that the notion of a singular art world will have to give way to that of 'art worlds', the point being, as Myers has suggested,'to imagine conditions of cultural heterogeneity, rather than those of consensus, as the common situation of cultural interpretation' (1994: 13). The argument is based on a detailed analysis of the contending practice and discourse of two - of the several - groups involved with a traditional craft in coastal Orissa. More specifically the article explores the relation between the pragmatic concerns of patta chitra painters regarding their work on the one hand and the Indian art elite's priorities on the other. A central issue is the way the painters, as agents, seek to influence the reality in which they live. The specific case of a painter, who contextually has reframed Sanskrit extracts in order to secure his position as an acknowledged artist, illustrates the creative aspect of agency.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000083798200005	
J	Pink, S								Panos for the brancus - Interweaving cultures, producing cloth, visualizing experience, making anthropology								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				4	2			163	182					JUL 1999	1999	This article represents an attempt to develop a reflexive approach to the question of how material and visual elements of culture are involved in the practices through which anthropological meanings are constructed. Implicit to this approach is a critical perspective on some existing approaches to the visual, material and conversational within visual anthropology and an attempt to relate the anthropological practice of photographing technological process and artifacts to more recently articulated epistemological and representational issues in anthropology. I focus on different visual, material, textual and conversational narratives produced during field work with a Manjaco weaver in Guinea Bissau in 1997 to explore how these may be usefully situated in the processes of anthropological research and representation. In doing so I discuss how photographic images and technologies, traditional weaving technologies, woven cloth, field dairies and conversations become the sites at which diverse and sometimes competing realities are constructed, represented, negotiated and interlinked.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000081919400003

J	Alleyne-Dettmers, PT								Ancestral voices - Trevini - A case study of meta-masking in the Notting Hill Carnival								JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CULTURE				3	2			201	221		10.1177/135918359800300204			JUL 1998	1998	This article presents one case study of contemporary Carnival as played out on the streets of Notting Hill, London. Its major focus is the carnival performance context and the genre of Carnival. This refers to Caribbean peoples' aesthetic cultural representations: masquerade themes that are played (manifested and enacted in) mas (unscripted dramatic costuming) at carnival time. It is the first phase(1) of an ongoing study that examines the processes by which the Afro-Caribbean diasporic community, dispossessed by European colonization, continually seeks to forge its own voice - its national and even other identities - through its multi-faceted carnival festival. From these themes it becomes evident that the resources used by the mas people (creative artists) to create carnival designs (artistic depictions) are continual evocations of multiple-cultural configurations left by various ancestors both of the colonizer and of the colonized. These ancestral voices run the gamut from Amerindian myths to European, African and Asian cultural influences. The case study demonstrates that the ancestral past is neither static nor forgotten. Instead these cultural vestiges - ancestral voices - are regenerated and re-inscribed into the productive creation of new accounts and new myths. The new Voices appear not only with other meanings and other values but also in another language, representative of Afro-Caribbean diasporic peoples' ongoing quest for a national identity.Any understanding of Trinidadian Carnival and its extension, Netting Hill Carnival, has to be understood against that backdrop process of recreating, re-defining, re-evaluating, changing but continually becoming what I have celled meta-masking - in this paper and elsewhere (Alleyne-Dettmers, 1993: 5) - as the culture matures and grows. In addition, this article shows how colonization affected the perceptions of the colonized subject and suggests that there is a continual highly successful negotiation of ethnic diversity in society, with Carnival providing the forum to recognize that ethnic diversity. Paradoxically, however, an agenda of unity is pursued.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000075080900004

The sale of furusatohai produce takes place by means of a gift-like idiom in which the relationship between producer and consumer is likened to that between village parents and migrant children. The furusatohai is a Japanese example of the symbolic personalization of commodities.A particular enterprise is analysed in relation to the ostensive entrepreneurial vision of its founder for whom the maternal furusatokai products would appeal first and foremost to migrant sons in the city. However, this filiocentric vision of market demand has proved to be at odds with the actual profile of consumers. Instead, it is suggested that the maternal appeal of the furusatokai is better understood as providing consumer reassurance in a market situation of quality uncertainty.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-1835			WOS:000075080900002
