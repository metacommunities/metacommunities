- check guidelines for sss [https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE]
- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran

- characterize github as only one of top 100 media sites that is about coding
- perhaps add timeline as organizing narrative of the paper? -- see timeline branch for latest version

- add some open source literature like Kelty & Coleman
- if using capital number, write a short passage describing it
- will probably be a combination of desrosieres and verran, with some boltanski/thevenot?
- list sections/minianalyses that need to be written
- in account of what people do with the data, make sure to mention that this recursive work on the platform is also what capitalises the number more
wrote abstract

playing with bigqueries to look at the repo census again. Tried
1. stus basic repo event count -- can use this to cut up repo count
2. started some work on durations using Richard's repo census query which makes a wide table of events, etc. 

Needed to modify queries as they were all using repo names not urls. 
Also saved repo event count  top 1000  as csv to data in data_analysis. Can easily plot this to show power law distribution of the event counts. Could also fit distributions using poweRlaw package, but not sure what the point would be ... But the main thing is that the cumulative event counts show very quickly that most repos have few events. 
Could then add to that the number of repos that are forks.

- looking at abstract again - it seems to be doing too much. Maybe I need something simpler. Oh, but then I was looking at the old abstract. The new one is in plan.md 
- did the number bibliographic work -- need to assemble the argument, tho. 
- seems very little sthv but quite a bit in sss. Not sure why that is. Particularly relevant pieces would be Lampland on False numbers; Law & Callon on qualcalculation; 
- also put refs from Distinktion into zotero folder -- nafus, lury, etc, should be useful
- had the idea of setting out a middle ground between science and technology, between literature and things inhabited by software and other such things
- also had the idea of reassessing counting in sts more generally -- how do we do it ourselves?

- drifing through Guyer on percentage and ordinals, Dumit on implosion, 
- had the idea that numbers are a way to think about the bits of infrastructure that are forgotten or hard to study in infrastructural studies ... borrowed this from sss manuscript
- spent quite a lot time remapping keys
- looked up Derrida on capital -- if I'm going with the notion of capital numbers, then the different senses of capital -- liable to death (loss of head?), standing at the head (city or a name), accumulated wealth, etc
- these different senses suggest possibility of looking at names in terms of capitals?
- re-wrote new abstract again. It's still too long. Need to cut down to 5-6 sentences. At the moment, its 280 words.

- did a lot of notes on paper copy of material cultures seminar printout. Some should be brought in here. 
- could flesh out accounts of code using a bit of David Berry as well as Kelty, Coleman, etc.

- finding it hard to get back into this article, but really think I should concentrate on the working with numbers thing


## Mon Feb 15 11:01:32 GMT 2016

- writing abstract for easst, realised that Badiou on numbers has some really useful stuff to think with. Have a new title to use on the basis of that -- 'Capital numbers and the obscure numericality of coding practice.'
- also had the idea that I could look at the ways in which numbers work in code repositories -- how many numbers? different organisations of numbers? Need to think about how the numbers work there.
    - is there any change in the way numbers are being used? Are the kinds of numbers there different from what they were before? Is there a greater prevalence of the time-stamp than before? Or, are timestamp's being invoked in different ways? 
    - could follow up these in later projects?

# TODO


- *DONE* assemble the sts references on number that I'm referring to -- Porter, Desrosieres, Hacking, Mackenzie, Verran, Scandinavia journal, Latour, Law, Callon
- *DONE* add all to zotero and set up bib files 
- Write section on capital numbers - will need to include examples such as Facebook, perhaps genome, maybe iphones, etc;
- read material on numbers assembled in zotero + archives.
