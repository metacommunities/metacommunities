## Wed Dec 16 11:24:51 GMT 2015

- check guidelines for sss [https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE)
- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran

## Thu Dec 17 11:53:59 GMT 2015
- characterize github as only one of top 100 media sites that is about coding
- perhaps add timeline as organizing narrative of the paper? -- see timeline branch for latest version


## Fri Dec 18 13:51:19 GMT 2015
- add some open source literature like Kelty & Coleman
- if using capital number, write a short passage describing it
- will probably be a combination of desrosieres and verran, with some boltanski/thevenot?
- list sections/minianalyses that need to be written
- in account of what people do with the data, make sure to mention that this recursive work on the platform is also what capitalises the number more
wrote abstract

## Tue Jan 05 11:40:33 GMT 2016
playing with bigqueries to look at the repo census again. Tried
1. stus basic repo event count -- can use this to cut up repo count
2. started some work on durations using Richard's repo census query which makes a wide table of events, etc. 

Needed to modify queries as they were all using repo names not urls. 
Also saved repo event count  top 1000  as csv to data in data_analysis. Can easily plot this to show power law distribution of the event counts. Could also fit distributions using poweRlaw package, but not sure what the point would be ... But the main thing is that the cumulative event counts show very quickly that most repos have few events. 
Could then add to that the number of repos that are forks. 

## Mon Jan 25 10:32:26 GMT 2016
- looking at abstract again - it seems to be doing too much. Maybe I need something simpler. Oh, but then I was looking at the old abstract. The new one is in plan.md 
- did the number bibliographic work -- need to assemble the argument, tho. 
- seems very little sthv but quite a bit in sss. Not sure why that is. Particularly relevant pieces would be Lampland on False numbers; Law & Callon on qualcalculation; 
- also put refs from Distinktion into zotero folder -- nafus, lury, etc, should be useful
- had the idea of setting out a middle ground between science and technology, between literature and things inhabited by software and other such things
- also had the idea of reassessing counting in sts more generally -- how do we do it ourselves?


## Wed Jan 27 11:12:51 GMT 2016
- drifting through Guyer on percentage and ordinals, Dumit on implosion, 
- had the idea that numbers are a way to think about the bits of infrastructure that are forgotten or hard to study in infrastructural studies ... borrowed this from sss manuscript
- spent quite a lot time remapping keys
- looked up Derrida on capital -- if I'm going with the notion of capital numbers, then the different senses of capital -- liable to death (loss of head?), standing at the head (city or a name), accumulated wealth, etc
- these different senses suggest possibility of looking at names in terms of capitals?
- re-wrote new abstract again. It's still too long. Need to cut down to 5-6 sentences. At the moment, its 280 words.

## Mon Feb  1 21:01:06 GMT 2016
- did a lot of notes on paper copy of material cultures seminar printout. Some should be brought in here. 
- could flesh out accounts of code using a bit of David Berry as well as Kelty, Coleman, etc. 

## Thu Feb  4 12:48:32 GMT 2016
- finding it hard to get back into this article, but really think I should concentrate on the working with numbers thing

## Mon Feb 15 11:01:32 GMT 2016
- writing abstract for easst, realised that Badiou on numbers has some really useful stuff to think with. Have a new title to use on the basis of that -- 'Capital numbers and the obscure numericality of coding practice.'
- could use Badiou to argue that STS accounts of number need to differentiate between different numericalities coming into play
- also had the idea that I could look at the ways in which numbers work in code repositories -- how many numbers? different organisations of numbers? Need to think about how the numbers work there.
- is there any change in the way numbers are being used? Are the kinds of numbers there different from what they were before? Is there a greater prevalence of the time-stamp than before? Or, are timestamp's being invoked in different ways? 
- could follow up these in later projects?

## Tue Feb 16 09:52:16 UTC 2016
- looking at numbers notes -- Badiou, etc. Looking for the argument about number as the cultural fabric ... 
- had the idea of number as the cultural fabric; but how would this follow from the names, etc. 
- also look at zotero folder again 
- created a file of number related points and quotes from zotero folder -- see number.md
- added quotes to this from muniesa and callon in particular around calculation. Also the stuff there on algorithms is quite good on calculation. 
- am I using the number literature to point to particular aggregate numbers? To say that these numbers are calculative devices that function as  part of a market for the platform to both coders and investors? So they are double numbers? To say that they are part of a more general economy of large numbers that suggest an incalculable proliferation, a bit like the P Prime case? Big numbers that have an aura or ritual *function*, or that suggest 'infrastructural aura'? Savage 
- also had the idea from Muniesa and Callon that could think of Github as a calculative space like a market for code. Are publics/markets calculative agencies? Strange that the computational goods should become calculable goods encountering calculative agencies ... 
- the idea is that the github's numbers also work like the false numbers that lampland describes in the way they stabilise the platform. Even the DoS attacks from China would play out here as part of the geopolitical capitalisation. 
- if using Muniesa/Callon on calculation, would need to use the 3 moments of calculation -- separating, listing and synthesizing


## Tue Feb 16 16:44:59 UTC 2016
- looked up Desrosiere's more recent work and added reference to the zotero folder -- maybe useful, but nothing specific came up ... 
- good to use scopus to get chapters from books

## Wed Feb 17 10:05:13 UTC 2016
- pfaffed with extracting images from slides for a while. In case needed for article
- put a lot more into abstract, using literature on calculation, and trying to stay true to the configuration work needed to do the counting. 
- looked at who cites Badiou on number - some papers in EP D. Nothing crucial there. 


## Thu Feb 18 05:39:27 GMT 2016
- on train to london - very early. Working out which bits of the abstract I have already written
- added reactivity of numbers from Gerlitz -- that's useful for many of the lower level numbers on Github
- turned the abstract into a series of headings for the new doc sss.md 7 sections overall, two of which could be intro and conclusion
- wrote the first section on sts and numbers, and the 2nd section on STS calculative agency ... 
- started the section on capital numbers -- a bit of repetition coming in here. But has the idea of 'capitalised number' as a better term. 

## Sun Feb 21 22:43:17 GMT 2016
- need to add some stuff on gitorious, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.
- there is a full list of gitorious repos -- 120k -- that made me think of Harman's tool being, and Bryant's onto-graphy as a theoretical framings. 

## Mon Feb 22 14:45:00 UTC 2016
- growing sense of being locked into github and why that might be problematic http://agateau.com/2016/github-lock-in/ -- should I include this?


## Tue Feb 23 10:00:26 UTC 2016
- got a bit distracted looking at numbers over time in Github wayback archive, and writing a script about it.
- trying to get my head back into what I wrote on the train last Thursday
- got cochoy on captation (in archive); could add to the notion of capital number
- managed to get sample event in, and started to link to counting ... a bit wobbly, but might work. Might need to bring in the interface methods argument?


## Wed Feb 24 13:33:22 UTC 2016
- got into the sensemaking material ok. struggling a bit to keep the sts literature there -- did a bit on Latour, but nothing too substantial. 
- worked with the idea that the naming of entities allows their association, and this association is intensive; this grows the capital numbers; but also places a burden of increasing nameability or naming on all things. 


## Thu Feb 25 11:45:59 UTC 2016
- today things went a bit better. Got rest of Github data challenge examples in -- 3800 words, and used them to frame capital numbers. Added more Latour on partial wholes. Which wholes are we partial to? Does he use partial in that sense? Not really. Also note the importance of Tarde here ... 
- added extra references and subcollection to metacommunities on academic literature on gh. Probably need to move some more references in there
- haven't managed to include any screenshots of the data projects -- need to choose one or two for that. 

## Fri Feb 26 09:29:28 GMT 2016
- started on the imitation work -- ok for repos I think -- how do I know that 50% of repositories are clones? Also need to do this for people?
- trying to sort out the queries to do that

## Mon Feb 29 09:06:32 GMT 2016
- over the weekend, did some of the actor graphs -- pretty much the same pattern -- 90% of actors trigger less than 5 events. Which is not to say that they are not doing something elsewhere, just not on Github 
- need to merge analysis/actor_copying to get these graphs in .. 
- tried to do this merging, but code that was working in the other branch didn't work here. 
- also got sidetracked trying out R streamgraph package as an alternative to matplotlib and seaborn ...
- trying to get back to the argument -- bit nervous that the imitation argument is too weak. I have device specificity to point to (marres); and the more Tardean point about association.
- added a bit on the actual timeline dataset -- trying to give more specificity to that. 
- got a bit of the way into imitation -- need to move to device specific stuff

## Tue Mar  1 15:56:13 UTC 2016
- trying to recover direction by drawing on Lucy's idea of configuration as (0) bounds and composition of the object (2) ways in which technologies materialize cultural imaginaries and vice versa 48
- added some configuration in near the beginning and started to bring it in towards the end. 
- I need to do some work on imitation -- grepped for imitation in archive, and saved results as imitat.txt

## Wed Mar  2 10:04:20 UTC 2016
- fixing up the table of event counts. Maybe that should go earlier. And I'm thinking the actual capital numbers I use should be synced with the timeline data, so that I have a clear view of particular numbers
- about to write something about imitation as seen in names
- put a couple of paras drawing on huge imitation literature, and started to write about ways of resisting their expansion. Too often it feels like imitative theory wants itself to go viral, rather than staying situated. Configuration might be answer to this ... or it might implode ...  
- I like the point about there being no infrastructure -- should check that out more

## Thu Mar  3 16:14:29 GMT 2016
- worked in repo_name_imitation branch today -- did mini-analysis of the repo-names, and wrote about 1k words on that. Much more there about configuration, and the idea that imitation is substantially concerned with configuration on Github. Configurations are imitated, and configuration is imitative. 
- not sure how to link this with capital numbers: re-figuring accumulation without relying on general network effects? 
- also had the idea of tracking mirroring more generally -- how much of the capital numbers accrues from imitation occurring elsewhere -- Github as a mirror of other places ... a stronger sense of meta-community here ...  

## Fri Mar  4 09:05:17 GMT 2016
- still feels like I need to read the configurative events in terms of Marres
- I'm trying to say in this section around configuration and imitation that much of what happens in imitative is configurative in that double sense. It enters into the composition of things, and is inhabited by imaginaries of wholeness, identification, connection and participation. 
- will need to write a section where I summarise effects of capital numbers. 
- putting the verran stuff on going on with numbers into intro; rejigging callon and suchman to pose the 'going on with numbers' a bit more constructively. 
- also brought in long quote from Lucy about configuration and its two uses
- looking at what I wrote about device-specific configurations in numbers, maybe I don't to bring in the analysis from yesterday -- all the stuff on showing how configuration pervades everything... 
- but I did bring it in -- word count at 6.5k; 
- did a lot of fixing of numbers --- making sure that 29 million is the main number ... 

## Mon Mar  7 09:29:06 UTC 2016
- want to draft the conclusion now, even though I haven't quite finished the section on configurative numbers. 
- for the conclusion, can bring in some stuff from older draft, but will also need to add the configurative argument -- that sts numericality does two things; it keeps both sides of the split that Badiou makes in play.
- so I brought in the conclusion from material cultures paper, but I don't think it is quite right.


## Tue Mar  8 09:47:10 UTC 2016

- putting idea of configurative numbers into the conclusion
- went through intro to number a bit and tightened it.; adding references to Leydesdorff
- wrote quite a bit on the conclusion; felt like cutting some bits but left them; 
- still not happy with configurative discussion, and avoiding doing what needs to be on device-specific. 
- added token acknowledgments; 
- check if still need to bring more of the device-specific configurative discussion into the paper

## Wed Mar  9 08:57:39 GMT 2016
- maybe add something about the ontology of number, and how this writing, the code that I did for this has been part of the object of analysis
- moved event count table higher in the piece, and started to format it using xtable. 
- spent quite a lot of time querying for languages and events, thinking that there might be a pattern there. Partly drawing on stirling idea of diversity, and thinking that it might be possible to represent diversity ... 
- add the new phrase 'multiply multiple' to address the ontological work ... suggests also the possibility of a new title


## Thu Mar 10 09:25:45 GMT 2016
- not going to do much today -- spent hours last night looking at how to query more recent Github data, using json payload, and date ranges. 
- brought in list of visualizations from GithubArchive -- might be good to add some of these
- rewrote abstract in the plan.md
- did some more tweaking on the sts intro stuff
- changed file from .md to .rmd
- maybe almost ready to go -- do I need to redo the images in ggplot? could leave it to after refereeing is done ... 

## Fri Mar 11 10:39:06 GMT 2016

- got very distracted by null language repositories, and then wrote mini-analysis of those. They do suggest that the 29 million cannot be verified. Do I need to do this?  
- making some screenshots for illustrations
- added the screenshots and now trying to run pandoc
- knitting file, and found whole duplicated section on dotfiles. How did that happen? 

## Mon Mar 14 12:06:12 UTC 2016

- been in meeting so didn't get much done
- printed out an odt with most references -- still needs table formatting, etc; and diagrams not appearing. 
- need to go through and read it, but don't want to do that. Read to page 7/30, so did start

## Tue Mar 15 09:36:09 UTC 2016

- fixing up the table formatting at the moment. Changed xtable to kable. Could also use pander ... 
- now fixing up references -- moving urls into zotero
- went through the printout reading it again -- found quite  a few problems. Glad I did this. Also shows the need for much more work on diagrams. Do I have, for instance, some code that re-generates the event distributions? I'm sure I have, but where is it? In this branch or some other?
- got a bit distracted working on the hp to look at a million names -- had to do a lot of configuration work to get bigrquery running and to get a million names downloaded


## Wed Mar 16 10:01:06 UTC 2016

- labelling figures. Not going to use the latex approach  -- too much pfaffing
- brought across repo events figure from analysis/repo_census work
- had some ideas, after teaching yesterday, that I should be saying more about where I am in this, and while I was running this morning, thought of how I hope for so much from software, and how I get going into hoping to find something there. 
- it is an irony that we can't tell who is a person and what is a machine in the making of software. And we can't tell what is really software and what is talk about software (configurations/) 
- added Bucher on APIs -- could do more on this perhaps
- go to page 14/30 in adding revisions


## Thu Mar 17 09:31:22 UTC 2016

- starting from p14 -- played around with worktrees, etc. Still have a problem with ideas branch. 
- went through more corrections <17. This seems slow, but quite a bit of work to do here. Total manuscript pages  = 24, so getting there. 
- really need to redo the distribution of events figure -- ok, i've brought in the repo_event counts figure from repo_census ... At least it's on the full timeline. Could re-do Richards three graphs, but would need to update the original tables to do that. 


## Fri Mar 18 10:11:48 GMT 2016
- spent a while installing new pandoc and pandoc filter for fignumbers
- writing a build script for the article
- need to decide whether to put android and bootstrap images in. In either case, they still need re-building to get to 2015. They are both in there!
- spent ages getting bibliography sorted --  2 hours? Seems ok now. Mainly moving things into the right folders. Wish there was a better way ... 
- and finally got clean pdfs and docx from pandoc -- forgot to see the xelatex engine for a while and that was making more errors. pdf looks good.
- now need to revise manuscript from p18 onwards
