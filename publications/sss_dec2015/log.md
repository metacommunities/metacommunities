- check guidelines for sss [https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE]
- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran

- characterize github as only one of top 100 media sites that is about coding
- perhaps add timeline as organizing narrative of the paper? -- see timeline branch for latest version

- add some open source literature like Kelty & Coleman
- if using capital number, write a short passage describing it
- will probably be a combination of desrosieres and verran, with some boltanski/thevenot?
- list sections/minianalyses that need to be written
- in account of what people do with the data, make sure to mention that this recursive work on the platform is also what capitalises the number more

wrote abstract

playing with bigqueries to look at the repo census again. Tried
1. stus basic repo event count -- can use this to cut up repo count
2. started some work on durations using Richard's repo census query which makes a wide table of events, etc. 

Needed to modify queries as they were all using repo names not urls. 
Also saved repo event count  top 1000  as csv to data in data_analysis. Can easily plot this to show power law distribution of the event counts. Could also fit distributions using poweRlaw package, but not sure what the point would be ... But the main thing is that the cumulative event counts show very quickly that most repos have few events. 
Could then add to that the number of repos that are forks.

- looking at abstract again - it seems to be doing too much. Maybe I need something simpler. Oh, but then I was looking at the old abstract. The new one is in plan.md 
- did the number bibliographic work -- need to assemble the argument, tho. 


# TODO

- *DONE* assemble the sts references on number that I'm referring to -- Porter, Desrosieres, Hacking, Mackenzie, Verran, Scandinavia journal, Latour, Law, Callon
- *DONE* add all to zotero and set up bib files
