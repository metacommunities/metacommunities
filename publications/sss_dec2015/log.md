- check guidelines for sss [https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE]
- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran

- characterize github as only one of top 100 media sites that is about coding
- perhaps add timeline as organizing narrative of the paper? -- see timeline branch for latest version


## Fri Dec 18 13:51:19 GMT 2015

- add some open source literature like Kelty & Coleman
- if using capital number, write a short passage describing it
- will probably be a combination of desrosieres and verran, with some boltanski/thevenot?
- list sections/minianalyses that need to be written
- in account of what people do with the data, make sure to mention that this recursive work on the platform is also what capitalises the number more
wrote abstract

playing with bigqueries to look at the repo census again. Tried
1. stus basic repo event count -- can use this to cut up repo count
2. started some work on durations using Richard's repo census query which makes a wide table of events, etc. 

Needed to modify queries as they were all using repo names not urls. 
Also saved repo event count  top 1000  as csv to data in data_analysis. Can easily plot this to show power law distribution of the event counts. Could also fit distributions using poweRlaw package, but not sure what the point would be ... But the main thing is that the cumulative event counts show very quickly that most repos have few events. 
Could then add to that the number of repos that are forks.

- looking at abstract again - it seems to be doing too much. Maybe I need something simpler. Oh, but then I was looking at the old abstract. The new one is in plan.md 
- did the number bibliographic work -- need to assemble the argument, tho. 
- seems very little sthv but quite a bit in sss. Not sure why that is. Particularly relevant pieces would be Lampland on False numbers; Law & Callon on qualcalculation; 
- also put refs from Distinktion into zotero folder -- nafus, lury, etc, should be useful
- had the idea of setting out a middle ground between science and technology, between literature and things inhabited by software and other such things
- also had the idea of reassessing counting in sts more generally -- how do we do it ourselves?


## Wed Jan 27 11:12:51 GMT 2016

- drifing through Guyer on percentage and ordinals, Dumit on implosion, 
- had the idea that numbers are a way to think about the bits of infrastructure that are forgotten or hard to study in infrastructural studies ... borrowed this from sss manuscript
- spent quite a lot time remapping keys
- looked up Derrida on capital -- if I'm going with the notion of capital numbers, then the different senses of capital -- liable to death (loss of head?), standing at the head (city or a name), accumulated wealth, etc
- these different senses suggest possibility of looking at names in terms of capitals?
- re-wrote new abstract again. It's still too long. Need to cut down to 5-6 sentences. At the moment, its 280 words.

## Mon Feb  1 21:01:06 GMT 2016
- did a lot of notes on paper copy of material cultures seminar printout. Some should be brought in here. 
- could flesh out accounts of code using a bit of David Berry as well as Kelty, Coleman, etc. 

## Thu Feb  4 12:48:32 GMT 2016
- finding it hard to get back into this article, but really think I should concentrate on the working with numbers thing

## Mon Feb 15 11:01:32 GMT 2016

- writing abstract for easst, realised that Badiou on numbers has some really useful stuff to think with. Have a new title to use on the basis of that -- 'Capital numbers and the obscure numericality of coding practice.'
- could use Badiou to argue that STS accounts of number need to differentiate between different numericalities coming into play
- also had the idea that I could look at the ways in which numbers work in code repositories -- how many numbers? different organisations of numbers? Need to think about how the numbers work there.
    - is there any change in the way numbers are being used? Are the kinds of numbers there different from what they were before? Is there a greater prevalence of the time-stamp than before? Or, are timestamp's being invoked in different ways? 
    - could follow up these in later projects?

- looking at numbers notes -- Badiou, etc. Looking for the argument about number as the cultural fabric ... 
- had the idea of number as the cultural fabric; but how would this follow from the names, etc. 
- also look at zotero folder again 
- created a file of number related points and quotes from zotero folder -- see number.md
- added quotes to this from muniesa and callon in particular around calculation. Also the stuff there on algorithms is quite good on calculation. 
- am I using the number literature to point to particular aggregate numbers? To say that these numbers are calculative devices that function as  part of a market for the platform to both coders and investors? So they are double numbers? To say that they are part of a more general economy of large numbers that suggest an incalculable proliferation, a bit like the P Prime case? Big numbers that have an aura or ritual *function*, or that suggest 'infrastructural aura'? Savage 
- also had the idea from Muniesa and Callon that could think of Github as a calculative space like a market for code. Are publics/markets calculative agencies? Strange that the computational goods should become calculable goods encountering calculative agencies ... 
- the idea is that the github's numbers also work like the false numbers that lampland describes in the way they stabilise the platform. Even the DoS attacks from China would play out here as part of the geopolitical capitalisation. 
- if using Muniesa/Callon on calculation, would need to use the 3 moments of calculation -- separating, listing and synthesizing


## Tue Feb 16 16:44:59 UTC 2016

- looked up Desrosiere's more recent work and added reference to the zotero folder -- maybe useful, but nothing specific came up ... 
- good to use scopus to get chapters from books

## Wed Feb 17 10:05:13 UTC 2016
- pfaffed with extracting images from slides for a while. In case needed for article
- put a lot more into abstract, using literature on calculation, and trying to stay true to the configuration work needed to do the counting. 
- looked at who cites Badiou on number - some papers in EP D. Nothing crucial there. 


## Thu Feb 18 05:39:27 GMT 2016

- on train to london - very early. Working out which bits of the abstract I have already written
- added reactivity of numbers from Gerlitz -- that's useful for many of the lower level numbers on Github
- turned the abstract into a series of headings for the new doc sss.md 7 sections overall, two of which could be intro and conclusion
- wrote the first section on sts and numbers, and the 2nd section on STS calculative agency ... 
- started the section on capital numbers -- a bit of repetition coming in here. But has the idea of 'capitalised number' as a better term. 

## Sun Feb 21 22:43:17 GMT 2016

- need to add some stuff on gitorious, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.
- there is a full list of gitorious repos -- 120k -- that made me think of Harman's tool being, and Bryant's onto-graphy as a theoretical framings. 

## Mon Feb 22 14:45:00 UTC 2016

- growing sense of being locked into github and why that might be problematic http://agateau.com/2016/github-lock-in/ -- should I include this?

# TODO

- *DONE* assemble the sts references on number that I'm referring to -- Porter, Desrosieres, Hacking, Mackenzie, Verran, Scandinavia journal, Latour, Law, Callon
- *DONE* add all to zotero and set up bib files 
- Write section on capital numbers - will need to include examples such as Facebook, perhaps genome, maybe iphones, etc;
- *DONE* read material on numbers assembled in zotero + archives.
- read Badiou again to see if anything there goes along with work on number
- **DONE** check citations of Badiou on number
- get desrosiere on politics of large numbers
- do some notes from Lucy on configuration
- add Ingmar on numbers, etc
