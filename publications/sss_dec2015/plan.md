## Title

Dis-counting large numbers: how copying makes things big

## Abstract

What constitutes good counting today?  
This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a large or 'capital' number, in this case, the approximately 20 million code repositories on the social media platform Github.
Science Studies work has a decades-long interest in numbers and counting, both in understanding the power-politics of numbering and the diversity of numbering practices.
Recent Science Studies debates have centred on both the accountability of numberings, and the practical making of number-based accounts in all their implications for ontology.
These debates stand against a broader background of sociological debates about challenges to empirical methods posed by increasingly abundant digital data.
Drawing on these accounts of number, the paper will suggest that science studies might develop ways of disaggregating capital numbers.
In the Github case, the genesis of capital numbers, such as '12 million' or '300 million,' can be disaggregated in two different ways.
We can attend to the processes that practically invest in and supplement those numbers with measurements, diagrams and statements that translate them into  regimes of social, aesthetic,political, technical and commercial value. 
We can re-count some of the acts of imitation, copying, cloning and duplication that comprise the mundane practice of using the platform, and give rise to capital numbers.
This disaggregative or dis-counting of capital numbers has several implication for counting more generally. 
It directly contests the value-laden measures associated with certain large numbers, showing that capital numbers hide many inflationary processes.
It decouples any essential link between working with digital data and ontological invention. 
It suggests instead that any ontological or epistemic transformation associated with large number pivots on fragile, weak and diffuse collectives.
