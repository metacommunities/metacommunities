## Abstract

This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a single large number, in this case, the approximately 29 million code repositories on the social media platform Github.

Science studies and related fields have a decades-long interest in numbers and counting, both in understanding the power-politics of numbering and the diversity of numbering and calculative practices in science, business, health and government.

Debates have recently centred on the inherent instability of enumeration in practice [@Verran_2011], the functioning of numbers in media assemblages [@Gerlitz_2013], the being of number [@Badiou_2008], the productive falseness of numbers [@Lampland_2010] or the configuration of market calculations [@Callon_2005a]. This attention to the specificity of numbers stands against a background of sociological debates about challenges to empirical methods posed by increasingly abundant digital enumerations [@Mayer-Schonberger_2013; @Rogers_2012].

How amidst these accounts of number could STS itself produce numbers differently? Does STS have any calculative agency [@Muniesa_2005] amidst its field settings, its documents and data sets? 

Drawing on the experience of working with one number, the paper will suggest that science studies might develop ways of re-counting large numbers as capital numbers.

A capital number names an aggregate, imbues it with importance linked to infrastructural scale and complexity, and promises the potential to generate further accumulation. 

Capital numbers, such as Github's '29 million'  can be re-counted in two different ways.

We can analyse the sense-making processes that practically invest in and supplement those numbers with measurements, calculations, diagrams, figures and statements.

Such processes translate numbers into  regimes of social, aesthetic, political, technical and commercial value. 

We can also attempt to re-count large numbers by paying attention to the acts of imitation, copying, cloning and duplication characteristic of digital practices, and thereby show how they give rise to capital numbers. 

Such re-counting entail, however, costly activities and implicate STS in complex configurations [@SuchmanLucy_2012]. 

The re-counting of capital numbers has several implication for counting more generally. 

It directly contests the value-laden measures associated with certain large numbers, showing that capital numbers hide many inflationary processes.

It decouples any essential link between working with digital data and ontological invention. 

It suggests instead that any ontological or epistemic transformation associated with significantly large numbers -- for instance, in claims about the epistemic potentials of data --  pivots on the crafting of new calculative agencies for fragile, weak and diffuse collectives.
