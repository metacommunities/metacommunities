- check guidelines for sss [https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/social-studies-science#MANUSCRIPTSTYLE]
- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran

- add some open source literature like Kelty & Coleman
- if using capital number, write a short passage describing it
- will probably be a combination of desrosieres and verran, with some boltanski/thevenot?
- list sections/minianalyses that need to be written
- in account of what people do with the data, make sure to mention that this recursive work on the platform is also what capitalises the number more
