- look at 1970s work on counting and citations and see how it matters today -- use WoS
- look at recent marres/gerlitz article in sociological review for relevance of interface methods (device specific research, etc)
- look up critical making -- Ratto, etc. -- see sss zotero folder for reference -- and see if it helps say what I'm doing
- read Mackenzie on gaussian copula for stuff on methods
- read verran paper on relational empiricism from care issue of sss to follow up on verran
