# Capital numbers and their obscure numericalities

## Recounting a single large number


What constitutes good counting today? STS work has a long-standing interest in numbers and counting. In light of recent STS debates around the devices, agency and politics of counting, and amidst broader sociological debates about challenges to empirical methods posed by data mining, the acts of counting or numbering things come at a cost.  The forms of counting I explore will focus on problems of copying, duplicating, and imitation that render large numbers a moving substrate. We report on a deliberately naive attempt to count approximately 12 million code repositories on the social media platform Github. 

## Science studies and its numerical configurations

At almost every point in its history, STS has taken an active interest in what numbers do, who they matter to, and how they are made. The extraordinary diversity of numbering practices studied by STS and affiliated fields include measurements, enumerations [@Verran_2001],  calculation [@Callon_2005a], risks and chance, statistics [@Hacking_1990], indices [@Nafus_2014], metrics [@Burrows_2012], model parameters, or even computable numbers [@Mackenzie_1997b], as well as problematic and contested numbers [@Verran_2011; @Lampland_2010; @Miller_2009]. From this rich panoply of work, many lessons concerning the historical, contextual, material and political situatedness of numbers can be drawn. While crucial to our elementary senses of the multiple, numbers and numberings display reef-like growths and irregularities that resist  any attempt to distill their essence in a single mathematical formalism such as set or number theory. STS work has not itself shied away from working with and producing numbers. We need only think of the many metrical enterprises of actor network theorists in their work on co-word analyses of scientific literature [@Callon_1991] or indeed the software that Thomas Kuhn describes in the appendices to  _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ [@Kuhn_1996]. Numbers and to a less extent calculation have certainly counted in the development of STS sensibilities around sciences and technologies in and around the world.

## Does STS have a calculative configuration?

What then is the contemporary agency of STS around numbers? This is a daunting question in principle and practice, since it immediately opens onto the ethical, epistemological, infrastructural and economic entanglements of contemporary data practices [@Gitelman_2013; @Halpern_2015; @Ruppert_2013; @Kitchin_2014], as well as the sometimes costly calculative complexities found in many scientific, governmental and commercial domains. Economists [@Porter_2008], social physicists [@Pentland_2014], statisticians [@Desrosieres_2011] or data scientists [@Diggle_2015] have, it seems, exponentially greater calculative power than STS researchers in their work with numbers.    

If we follow STS's own accounts of devices, practices of enumeration and calculation, then matters might appear differently. We could think of numbers, for instance, in terms of configurations [@Suchman_2012]. If numbers are configured, they have boundaries and a composition not unlike other things or devices. A number might numerically materialize a cultural imaginary of inclusion, value, difference, or change.  Similarly, if we see the study of numbers today as an exploration of  what Michel Callon and Fabian Muniesa call 'calculative agency,' then it might make sense to see if the study of numbers itself might borrow or imitate some of the operations of calculative agency that crystallize valued numbers in other settings:
    
>Isolating objects from their context, grouping them in the same frame, establishing original relations between them, classifying them and summing them up are all costly activities that raise the question of calculative power.[@Callon_2005a, 1232].

The three operations of isolating, grouping together, establishing relations, summing up are 'costly' because they need to be configured as a form of agency that draws on tools, devices, goods and services, and multiple expertises (in relation).  While in some ways calculative agency is precisely what we might not wish to accrue, since so many sciences and technologies already powerfully leverage and marshal numbers, the study of science and technology might might not be able entirely avoid it. Even if a form of calculative agency inheres in STS research, the ways and byways along which calculative STS agents encounter numbers will be diverse. Social media [@Marres_2015], scientific publications [@Leydesdorff_1998; @Latour_2012], scientific databases [@Bowker_2010a], official statistics, web-scraping [@Rogers_2004] present very different, albeit increasingly interwoven assemblies of number. As Callon and Muniesa observe, 'calculative agencies are as numerous and diverse as the tools they use and the hybrid collectives to which those tools belong' [@Callon_2005a, 1245]. If calculative agencies are diverse, then work of summing up will be too.    

## Re-counting a capital number on  a platform

If we are interested in the configuration of numbers and their calculative agency, how might we proceed? Since mid-2013, I have sought to develop some calculative agency around two numbers associated with the code repository/social media platform, Github.com. While the project focused largely on transformations in the social life of code, it also explicitly sought to experiment with data-intensive methods for  analysis of social re-assemblings and re-associations typical of places such as Github. In the configuration known as Github, two numbers have capital importance: the number of people using the platform, and the number of different code repositories stored there.   

Coding practices have changed over the last decade or so in fairly profound ways. The organization of software development has shifted away from massively centralized software development (the kind epitomised by Microsoft or IBM during the latter part of last century [@Campbell-Kelly_2003]) to a much more de-centralized process. The geography of coding still centres on well-established urban centres such as San Francisco and London [@Mackenzie_2016], but by virtue of a much wider distribution of coding tools and skills, occurs in many other places as well. Added to this geography, changes in digital devices and infrastructures, ranging from proliferating mobile devices and sensors to mushrooming data centres have widened the reach of coding. Code addresses much greater parts of the world today than it did at the turn of the century. At the same time, the circuits connecting the production, distribution, and use of code have thoroughly blurred. Code flows in much more diverse ways through infrastructures and devices. For instance, 'devops' (development-operations) brings coding directly into the ongoing transformative-maintenance of information infrastructure through continuous deployments, often direct from Github [@Mackenzie_2016b].  Across all of these changes, coding has become a much more *public* activity (see [@Kelty_2008]), and the *publicness of code* has become a major concern for business, government and science, albeit for different reasons (for instance, in scientific work, open data has been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of techniques, resources and tools for publishing code written for scientific purposes.

The social media site Github, started in in 2007, epitomises and has indeed been central -- as the suffix 'hub' suggests -- to these changes. Like many social media platforms,  it has grown tremendously in the last 7 years  to include around 31 million software projects (February 2016). When we started the project in 2013, that number was around 13 million, but each year that number grows greatly.   This growth flows from a tremendous variety of processes that are difficult to summarise or classify partly because the actors, topics or domains of coding are so diverse and partly because much of what flows through Github is both technical and social 'innovative' in the sense that Bruno Latour uses the term when he writes that 'innovative' means that we do not know the number of actors involved in advance [@Latour_1996, 72]. 

Like many contemporary assemblages, Github seeks to describe itself through large numbers, and these numbers in their sometimes daily changes and updates attest to an investment in being innovative or open-ended enumerations.  In June 2014, the Github homepage showed a photo of a women working in an urban office location, with lights and professional camera focused on her work. It described '6.1 million people collaborating right now across 13.2 million repositories ... building amazing things together'. In November 2015, Github has a slightly more functional description, and the image seems to be a press conference in China:

>GitHub is how people build software. With a community of more than 12 million people, developers can discover, use, and contribute to over 30 million projects using a powerful collaborative development workflow. [Github/About](https://web.archive.org/web/20151216055610/https://github.com/about)

 The numbers change over time alongside the composition of the actors involved (women coding and working at Github, a sore point for the company; Chinese developers using Github, but also political activists, leading to a denial of service attack on the Github, allegedly by the Chinese government [^3]). But the changing numbers, alongside the sometimes rather sublime scales of community (a 'community' of 12 million people?) certainly form part of Github's description.

 [^3]: Neither image -- the woman at work in a funk urban office or the press conference in China -- is arbitrary. Github was rocked in 2012 by allegations of sexism and mismanagement, particularly associated with one of the co-founders, who subsequently resigned and left Github (https://github.com/blog/1823-results-of-the-github-investigation
 ). In early 2015, Github itself was subject to a massive Denial oF Service attack, emanating from China. Reports alleged that the DoS attack targeted pro-democracy repositories on Github. Unlike its regulation of other social media platforms, China does not block Chinese citizens' use of Github because Github is seen as economically and commercially important for the software industry (https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/). 

How might we treat  numbers such as 12 million and 30 million? They have a specific texture and consistency as counts of actors associated with platforms, devices and infrastructures. In important ways they are part and parcel of platform politics and market economies [@Gillespie_2010]. Given the venture capital investments that Github has attracted in the last few years (\$US100 million from Andressen-Horowitz in 2012), these numbers affect flows of capital.  They may be 'false numbers' as Martha Lampland suggests, designed to enable certain forms of rationalization [@Lampland_2010]. They also have the feel of what Carolin Gerlitz and Celia Lury describe in their study of the social reputation website Klout as 'reactive numbers' meant to evoke further work, investment, action and engagement around those numbers [@Gerlitz_2014a].  The numbers 29 million or 13 million are examples of widely used numerical forms: enumerations of entities render Github as an enumerated entity [@Verran_2011, TBA]. While these numbers resemble others -- population statistics for small nations, amounts of money spent on a new building, a research programme or a CEO's remuneration -- they become visible, circulate and are seen in ways that prevent them from being easily assimilated to biopolitical or financial numbers. Their salience and pluri-potence will be described further below, but already they warrant some kind of designation and differentiation. We might call them 'capitalised numbers.'  Capital here has the triple sense of the centre, the capital letter, and the accumulated fund with potential to growth.   A capitalised number enumerates an aggregate, imbues it with importance linked to infrastructural scale and complexity, and promises the potential to generate further accumulation. 

## The litany of sense-making: enumerating the aggregate through events

What is enumerated on Github? The two main enumerations are 12 people and 30 repositories at the end of 2015. The people are software developers or codes. Repositories are collections of files mainly containing code, but also a great variety of configuration specific documents (settings, manuals, installation instructions, etc.). Any enumeration of Github contends with not only the sheer number of people visiting and using the platform, but the sheer diversity of ways in which they associate with each other through repositories. It is difficult to say which capital number matters more -- the head count or the repository count. On  Github, both normally appear in tandem: '2,641,337 people hosting over 4,442,708 repositories' announces the Github home page on 27 November 2012 (http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121119020031/http://github.com)[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20121119020031/http://github.com]. While date-linked numbers disappear on more recent versions of the site, the counting continues along a variety of other paths.   

While Github enumerates its own capital numbers on its webpage, those numbers re-play in other settings (for instance, in the many articles appearing in newspapers, magazines and business press about the popularity and growth of Github). Perhaps more importantly, they are re-counted in different ways. Take for instance the data published through the Github API (Application Programmer Interface). APIs  were not created as a data resource for social scientists, but for software developers working in convergence cultures [@Jenkins_2004] in which connecting different platforms, devices, sites and practices together using code has become standard practice. 

In Github's case, data published through the API refers to movements of code, and associative acts connected to coding. The data is generated as developers write code and store that code in repositories. Coding today constructs and take place in increasingly complex associative infrastructures.  Github consistently seeks to code coding as a social network practice. The collaboration or 'sharing' (to use social media keywords) includes both people and things. The format of the data that affords and records this associative structuring collocates people and things.  By convention, for instance, much API data from social media sites has an 'event' structure that links named actors and named entities to specific infrastructural locations (usually coded as an URL) at a particular time (the 'timestamp'). Events on the Github 'events' API (https://api.github.com/events)[https://api.github.com/events] are classified according to one of roughly twenty types.

The relatively simple  `WatchEvent` on Github shown in Figure 1 documents the act of an `actor` calling themselves `mmemetea` interested in the repository called `azondi`, a software project coordinated by the 'organisation' calling itself `OpenSensorsIO`.[^2]  Note that the event also has various status designations -- it is a `public` event, it has a 'payload' (often much more complicated than simply `started`) -- and includes various indexical references or `id`s that link the event to other groups of people, organisations, repositories and images (`gravatar_id`). The intricate  syntax of this data -- many brackets, inverted commas, colons, commas -- attests to a complex social coordination which aligns actors, actions, places and times in discrete events. The discreteness of such events attests to the potential for the precise configuration of actors around a given repository to change or mutate in some way. New actors might be added; relations might appear between entities; the location of entities might shift, and forms of association ('organizations') might subsume or grow out or around all of this. 

[^2]: In what follows, I use monospace font like `this` when referring to entities named in the Github data. The typography highlights entity subject to enumeration by capital numbers. 

Numbers such as '30 million' or '12 million' capitalize the capillary flow of associations  in and through named entities as repositories and people. They also suggest the possibility of navigating the capillary flow differently. Recent ANT work, such as Latour, Jensen, Venturini et. al's  'The Whole is Smaller than the Part: How Digital Navigation May Modify Social Theory,' argues that given a 'sudden proliferation of digital databases' [@Latour_2012, 18] and tools that allow us to move between different scales and locations in social fields, we no longer need the long-standing structural oppositions between structure and agency, between macro and micro [@Latour_2012]. We instead begin to inhabit a space of continuously transforming scales in which every given standpoint stabilises scales and boundaries of the whole for a particular actor in a perspectival variation. This vision of labile traceability is certainly offered in the  Github data. Does the public availability of data produced and used in associative practices allow us to re-count capital numbers differently? 

## Imbuing numbers with importance

A database purporting to contain the whole associative fabric of Github suddenly appeared in mid-2012.  A 'Web Performance Engineer' at Google called Ilya Grigorik launched a Github repository `igrigorik/githubarchive` linked to a website `GithubArchive.org` dedicated to amalgamating all the Github API public event data -- the so-called 'timeline' --  in one place [@Grigorik_2012].  Grigorik, or `igrigorik,` working at Google, had access to Google's infrastructure, and not only published all the data in a cloud-based data store but transformed that data, whose formatting we have discussed above, into the flat tabular forms familiar in much statistical work, and made it available through Google's newly launched cloud computing service, GoogleBigQuery.[^1] The [Github timeline data](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:github.timeline) was listed, along with all the words in Shakespeare and all the US birth name records, as one of three dataset exemplars that people could use to learn about GoogleBigQuery [@Google_2016]. Like the data on GithubArchive itself, the GoogleBigQuery copy of the Github public timeline data was updated hourly. Reaching back to  2012, it comprises around 290 million public events.[^6]

[^6]: In late 2015, the main GithubArchive timeline dataset was frozen. The last events date from October 2015. Data after that date flows into new datasets named by the month. e.g. [https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107) points to the data for July 2011. This re-tabling of the data attests partly to the increasing popularity of Github. For the purposes of my argument, and to simplify code slightly, I only make use of the main Github timeline dataset covering 2012-2015. For that reason too, the discussion here will focus on 12 million people and 30 million repositories as reported by Github in October 2015. 

[^1]: GoogleBigQuery, it seems, is the commercialisation of an internal infrastructure called `Dremel`, that Google has since 2006 used in many different ways to manage its own platforms. 
    • Analysis of crawled web documents.
    • Tracking install data for applications on Android Market.
    • Crash reporting for Google products.
    • OCR results from Google Books.
    • Spam analysis.
    • Debugging of map tiles on Google Maps.
    • Tablet migrations in managed Bigtable instances.
    • Results of tests run on Google’s distributed build system.
    • Disk I/O statistics for hundreds of thousands of disks.
    • Resource monitoring for jobs run in Google’s data centers.
    • Symbols and dependencies in Google’s codebase. [@Melnik_2010]

The archiving, copying and transformation of Github event data drew the attention many people, including Github itself. A succession of 'Github Data Challenges' ensued in the next three years (2012-2014) The fact Github itself organises 'data challenges' (https://github.com/blog/1544-data-challenge-ii-results) suggests that  people doing things with this data is part and parcel of the public life and publicity of the platform or device. These data challenges are what Anne-Lise Riles calls 'momentary apprehensions of depth' showed that drawing networks has long been part of networks [@Riles_2001, 184]. Whatever the reason for these data challenges (they are increasingly common in many places today in the form of hackathons, data competitions, etc.), they occasion practical re-countings of the data that imbue the capital numbers with greater mobility, value and media or inscriptive form. 

For instance,  the 'OpenSource Report Card' (http://osrc.dfm.io/)  or `dfm/osrc` by Dan Foreman-Mackay, is a prize-winning use of the timeline data. It ingests all the data from the Githubarchive, counting what developers do, when they do it, and using what programming languages. With this data stored, it then builds a predictive model that allows it to both characterise a given Github user, and to predict who that Github user might have affinities with. Here the mass of events in the Github timeline are brought to bear on finding similarities between people. The admonition from Foreman-Mackay  – 'Dear recruiters: While you read this, make sure that you remember that GitHub is not your C.V. and that these stats only provide a biased and one-sided view. This is just a toy. Don't take it too seriously! ' – suggests that even playful application of the data attest to its capitalisation. For coders, programmers and software developers, the profile of their contributions to Github repositories can be part of getting work. 

In response to the Github Data Challenge in 2012, people looked for feelings or 'sentiments' in the timeline data.  Feelings associated with coding were mined by counting emotional words present in comments accompanying the Github events (http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/). The presence of words in these message can be cross-linked with programming languages in order to profile how different programming languages elicit different emotional reactions. This emphasises how The emphasis how software developers or coders feel in relation to different kinds of work. Certain languages attract exasperation and others pleasure (see [@Coleman_2012] for a broader account of these feelings). For present purposes, the enumeration of affects around code animates the capital numbers of people and repositories with an underpinning reactivity associated with coding in all its vicissitudes [@Gerlitz_2014]. 

The capital number of people associated with Github also begins to acquire a geography through the GithubArchive data. People began to map coders and repositories by geographic location. The  mapping of Github contributions by location performed by David Fischer (http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/#languages/All) is typical in that it too counts events, but this time puts the emphasis on the geography of the 'top' repositories, coders and their programming languages. As the David Fischer puts it 'this data set contains contributions to the top 200 GitHub repositories during the first four months of 2013 and plots the location based on what the contributor provided' (http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/#languages/All)[http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/#languages/All].  

People also make live dashboards for Github. `Octoboard` (http://octoboard.com/) animates changes on Github using the timeline data. It ornaments the capital numbers with a range of peripheral live enumerations that point to the liveliness of events on Github. Like many other dashboards associated with social media analytics, `octoboard` suggests that the constant change in activities Data analysis is no longer something done in leisurely rhythms of analysis, but is increasingly framed as a realtime in the form of 'stream analytics.' That is, not also does the data stream, but the analysis is meant to stream as well in order to be timely, lively and responsive to change. Octoboard presents a summary of daily activity in major categories on Github – how many new repositories, how many issues, how repositories have been 'open sourced' today. It offers realtime analytics on emotions.

Looking slightly more widely,  the Github timeline data has quickly become a favourite training tool for data mining textbooks books that configure and convey the calculative agencies characteristic of capital numbers. In  *Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More,* Matthew Russell makes use of the Github timeline to demonstrate ways of uses social network analysis to highlight the important nodes and links between repositories and users [@Russell_2013]. Again, the propensity to apply network analysis approaches is widespread and endemic to the data itself, given the way that the event format is already implicitly framed by a network or 'social media' understanding. Github's capital numbers, however, become a point of enucleation for calculative agencies [@Callon_2005a, 1245] associated with the calculable goods embodied in code and software. 

For academic researchers in computer science and certain parts of management, Github has been a boon because they study technologically and economically important practices software development in the wild much more easily.  Academic researchers in fields such as software engineering do social network analysis in order to gauge productivity, reuse, efficiency and other engineering and management concern [@Thung_2013]. Like the many Github-hosted projects discussed above, they analyse sentiment [@Guzman_2014], collaboration and productivity [@Dabbish_2012], and geography [@Takhteyev_2010].

The diagramming, counting, measuring and statements generated by the many different treatments of the Github timeline data, particularly although not always in its transformation to a 'big data' queryable dataset on GoogleBigQuery affect the capital numbers that Github enumerates. They enliven, animate, reactivate, localise and qualify those the numbers in ways that highlight the 'natural multiplicity' [@Badiou_2008] of any aggregate. They potentialise the numbers in terms of promissory growth  and further accumulation by summing them up in different ways (realtime, networks of connections, geographies of work and affect), and by exemplifying the emerging forms of calculative agency (social network analysis, machine learning classification and prediction)  associated with the data itself.  

## Acts of infrastructural imitation

The calculative and diagrammatic projects centred on the Github  data in some ways resonate with an STS-orientation to numbers and enumerations more generally. They often calculatively synthesize diagrams that invite visual navigation to identify the ebb and flow of associations running through code projects. 'It might now be possible to account', write Latour, Jensen et. al 'for longer lasting features of social order by learning to navigate through overlapping ‘monads’ instead of alternating between the two levels of individual and aggregate' [@Latour_2012, 3]. While the capital numbers consistently split social order between the aggregates number and individual actors, the data visualizations offer different levels of navigation, sometimes sub-individual ('sentiment') and sometimes supra-individual (links between coders and repositories). The calculated diagrammatic enumerations function 'oligoptically': they offer a limited view of a whole [@Latour_2012, 11]. While capital numbers emphasise the whole, STS accounts of the making of views of the whole through enumeration attest to an always partial grasp of the whole, to the calculative stabilisation and discretisation of entities in a single frames.    

There is another way that we might re-count capital numbers in order to both further highlight their dynamic composition through flows of association and to highlight some of the highly reactive, performative work they do in enumerating commercial, financial and social value. Re-counting of capital numbers might begin with the seemingly trivially abundant yet absolutely basic entity in code and on  Github more generally, names. As seen in the sample event above, many entities in the  Github timeline data and on the platform more generally are named. Names refer to people, organisations, repositories, platforms, code libraries or packages, and a very wide range of devices  and places. If  Github's capital numbers count people and repositories ('code'), then what  would happen if we counted in the timeline data as published on GoogleBigQuery associations between people and repositories by tracking the popularity of different names? [^4]

[^4]: A host of methodological questions cluster around the question of counting names. For the purposes of this discussion, I leave aside the many sidetracks, dead-ends and catastrophic failures associated with working on a several hundred gigabyte dataset.

      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/powertime-wide.pdf}
        \caption{The power of events over time}
  \label{fig:power_time}
\end{figure}

Such a counting, undertaken in a very crude but heavily computational fashion, appears in \ref{fig:power_time}. This simple graphic suggests that the vast majority of repositories on Github are highly ephemeral. They attract one or two events. A small number of repositories, counted on the lower right-hand side of the plot capture many thousand events. Already, then, the capital number of repositories on  Github takes on a different complexion. 

Analysis of the event timeline suggests a great proportion of events in the data were trivial, and in particular, imitative. Millions of repositories flash into visibility on the timeline for a brief period before falling back into obscurity. The diagram shown in the Figure \ref{fig:power_time} encapsulates this imitative flux quite well. It comprises three graphs that count how many events are associated with repositories. On the left hand side, millions of repositories receive less than five events during the 18 months. On the right hand side, less than 50 repositories receive more than a thousand events. A similar pattern appears in the other capital number: while some 'people' (a person is not always easy to distinguish from a robot on Github) emit many thousands of events, others only trigger a few.[^5]

[^5]: In all this re-counting, the data relates to the public repositories and actors on Github. An unknown but substantial number of repositories are private. Given Github's financial valuation at $US 2 billion in 2015, this number may be quite large. [@Gage_2015]

Given that repositories are receptacles for all the work of software developers and coders, it seems strange that the vast bulk of them are so ephemeral. But rather than see this ephemerality as waste, noise or something to be discarded, we might trace the working of associative processes through it. Tracking the patterns of imitation, rather than looking for the events that define repositories as important, allows something different to appear.

Every event in this table names at least one sometimes two repositories, and at least one actor who might be a person or who might be a robot acting like a person. Examining just the names of repositories in the timeline data, counting how often and when they appear in events begins to show how associations are configured on Github. In particular, the movement of waves of imitation begins to show something of the dynamics that animate the growth of capital numbers.  These take two forms in the event data. We have already that  almost one half of the repositories in Github trigger only one event in the timeline data stream. What is this event? Many of these repositories arise from the act of copying ('forking') a repository. People 'fork' other repositories frequently. Table 1 shows 10 million ForkEvents, suggesting that around one third of the total 30 million repositories are direct copies.  Acts of copying occur on many scales and at various levels of infrastructural and associative complexity. This copying is vital to the 'sharing' practice of Github coding. Of the 290 million events in the timeline dataset, approximately 95 million result from copying, watching, commenting on or directly participating in other repositories. (The 140 million PushEvents shown in Table 1 might also be highly imitative, but their imitative character is less visible in the timeline data.)

The figures shown above show some localised aspects  of this counting of imitation. Both Figure \ref{fig:bootstrap_forks} and \ref{fig:android_forks} count imitations in the form of copying code, but in ways that go beyond the formal copying mechanisms offered by Github itself (for instance in the 'Fork' button that appears on the top right hand side of any repository on Github; for example [https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)). Imitations appears in two different ways in these figures. The broad bands of color rippling horizontally  across the middle of the figures graph the counts of copies being made each day on Github of popular repositories using the Fork action. In forking, the repository name remains the same.   But the much more dense striations  on either side of the central bands seen for instance in Figure \ref{fig:android_forks} count repositories whose names incorporate the important repository, but vary it in some way. These repositories have some association with the `android` repository, but diverge from it in a multiplicity of ways. A repository may, for instance, relate to the popular  Twitter `bootstrap` repository yet combine it with a range of other platforms and devices such as `android` or `jQuery`. Visually,  these marginal striations in the diagram still amount to imitations,  and they generate large numbers of events in the timeline dataset, but less homogeneously, and in greater multiplicity than the official copying mechanisms configured by Github itself as a social media platform. 

In striated zones of associative imitation, it is possible that something different could be counted. They augment the average everydayness of working with code with a form of associative work and investment of affective sentiment carried out through imitation and copying.  In this work, important repositories act as valued assets around which forms of identity take hold and multiply. Unlike the capital numbers with their aggregates of people or repositories, the imitative fluxes that begin to appear in these diagrams have diverse network-making configurations.   In the recombination of different names, we see some of 'the network effects that come from the imitative dynamics of actors' [@Arvidsson_2012, 141] or the 'multiplicity of imitative fluxes' [@Lazarrato_2002,132]. As relatively recent accounts of invention drawing on Gabriele Tarde's work have suggested, passionate imitation provides a powerful account of the operation of markets, economies, technical and expert knowledges and media [@Barry_2007; @Barry_2005; @Borch_2005;@Lepinay_2007; @Blackman_2007; @Latour_2008]. It may be that the flows of varying imitation we see in these figures amount to something like 'encounters and interferences of imitative rays' [@Lepinay_2007, 530] on Github, and in this respect, Github would be similar to Einstein's *capita* or head. Imitative repetition is write large here as the primary social process [@Tarde_social_lois_1901, 20] or as the ineluctable configuration of any sociality [@Tarde_lois_imitation_1_1895b, 11], generating both habits and stable organisations that might solidify into devices or systems, or might precipitate the restless dynamisms that capital numbers figure as an accumulation or a resource.   These figures suggest a way of re-counting capital numbers and their tendency to expand. This re-counting requires  a form of  calculative agency that works to re-animate the numbers in terms of the 'repetitive imitations' [@Tarde_1895,25] that weave the associative fabric of social process through, in this case, the naming and invocation of named entities. 

## The costs of numericality

Note that counting these associations differs from navigating a path through a network, as recent work on traceability or Tardean-inspired accounts of methodological transformation through database traceability might suggest [@Barry_2007,517]. The Tardean flavour of counting names in their repetition and variation should not mask other possible configurations of the calculative agency of STS research. Importantly, a primarily imitative understanding of the numericality of capital numbers does not help us grasp how these numbers or figures 'populate our sociomaterial imaginaries' [@Suchman_2012, 58]. The very act of counting these imitations has a device-specificity, in its reliance on the Github platform API, the GithubArchive timeline dataset and the GoogleBigQuery cloud analytic's platform, and indeed Github itself as the repository of the code and text comprising this article [@Metacommunities_2016]. The contagious expansive nature of the imitative account of social process might be immunised by attention to the device-specific configurations inhabiting the capital numbers.
