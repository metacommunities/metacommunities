Through this view of numbers in the making, we can see just how remarkable it is that indicators become part of calculative infrastructures at all. Nafus 2014

We thus explore the interlinked movement of numbers, media, and value in social media as a kind of dynamic assemblage. gerlitz and lury

works to impede calculation by an overload of qualculative resources. law and callon

 In the first section, we construct a broad definition of calculation, grounded on the anthropology of science and techniques.

    Isolating objects from their context, grouping them in the same frame,
    establishing original relations between them, classifying them and summing
    them up are all costly activities that raise the question of calculative power. 1232
    
    Calculative agencies are as numerous and diverse as the tools they use and the hybrid collectives to which those tools belong. Algorithmic configurations where calculative agencies and calculable goods come across each other are also multiple and diverse. These three elements (goods, agents and exchanges) constitute three possible starting-points for exploring markets as complex calculative devices. 1245

/home/mackenza/notes/arendt_human.md:The laws of statistics are valid only where large numbers or long periods are involved, and acts or events can statistically appear only as deviations or fluctations. The justification of statistics is that deeds and events are rare occurrences in everyday life and history. Yet the meaningfulness of everyday relationships is disclosed not in everyday life but in rare deeds, just as the significance of a historical period shows itself only in the few events that illuminate it. 42

/home/mackenza/notes/arendt_human.md:The application of the law of large numbers and long periods to politics or history signifies nothing less than the wilful obliteration of their very subject matter, and it is a hopeless enterprise to search for meaning in politics or significance in history when everything that is not everyday behaviour or automatic trends has been ruled out as immaterial. 43

/home/mackenza/notes/arendt_human.md:However, since the laws of statistics are perfectly valid when we deal with large numbers, it is obvious that every increase in population means an increased validity and a marked decrease of "deviation." Politically, this means that the larger the population in any given body politic, the more likely it will be the social rather than the political that constitute the public realm. 43

/home/mackenza/notes/cscw.md:As noted by a number of commentators, the work of meetings is often not simply about making decisions about items on the agenda, but ascertaining whether the language used to describe topics is held in common among the members of the group at the meeting.   'Most information is subject to strategic misrepresentation or unconscious bias". S Page7of19 –

/home/mackenza/notes/cscw.md:There is a large body of work from a number of systems perspectives that would consider GDSS as consisting of four major stages, viz. 1) Recognition of a need or problem ; 2) Generation of evaluative context ; 3) Evaluation of actions/consequences ; 4) Selection of action. Whitaker and many others (e.g. Jones, 1994) point out that many current GDSSs ignore stage 1, and much of stage 2, focusing on stages 3 and 4. There is too much focus on the selection stage, and insufficient time given to understanding the context of the different options. The consequences of this approach are serious. Since there is no room for discussion amongst the participants of the grounds on which information is deemed relevant to the task at hand, this model implicitly imposes a set of normative assumptions on the nature of the meeting process.

/home/mackenza/notes/foucault_archaeology.md:I now realize that I could not define the statement as a unit of a linguistic type (superior to the phenomenon of the word, inferior to the text); but that I was dealing with an enunciative function that involved various units (these may sometimes be sentences, sometimes propositions; but they are sometimes made up of fragments of sentences , series or tables of signs, a set of propositions or equivalent formulations); and, instead of giving a 'meaning' to these units, this function relates them to a field of objects; instead of providing them with a subject, it opens up for them a number of possible subjective positions; instead of fixing their limits, it places them in a domain of coordination and coexistence; instead of determining their identity, it places them in a space in which they are used and repeated. In short, what has been discovered is not the atomic statement - with its apparent meaning, its origin, its limits, and its individuality - but the operational field of the enunciative function and the conditions according to which it reveals various units (which may be, but need not be, of a grammatical or logical order) .  106

/home/mackenza/notes/foucault_order.md:in the sixteenth century, the fundamental supposition was that of a total system of correspondence (earth and sky, planets and faces, microcosm and macrocosm), and each particular similitude was then lodged within this overall relation. From now on , every resemblance must be subjected to proof by comparison, that is, it will not be accepted until its identity and the series of dits differences have been discovered by means of measurement with a common unit, or, more radically, by its position in an order. ... A complete enumeration will now be possible: whether in the form of an exhaustive census of all the elements constituting the envisaged whole, or in the form of a categorical arrangement that will articulate the field of study in its totality, or in the form of an analysis of a certain number of points, in sufficient number, taken along the whole length of the series. 55

/home/mackenza/notes/hansen_newmedia_2004.md:Rather than marking the obsolescence of framing as such ... the flexibility constitutive of  digital images operates a modification of the time-image, a new mode of framing or the actualizing of the virtual: specifically, it resituates the source of the virtual from the interstices between (series of) images to interstices within  the image itself. In a sense, it incorporates the virtual within the actual, making the image the source of an infinite number of potential alternate framings – a limitless generation of other images from any part of itself. 75

/home/mackenza/notes/latour_aramis.md:The full difficulty of innovation becomes apparent when we recognize that it brings together, in one place, on a joint undertaking, a number of interested people, a good half of whom are prepared to jump ship, and an array of things, most of which are about to break down.

/home/mackenza/notes/lewitt.md:To work with a plan that is pre-set is one way of avoiding subjectivity. It also obviates the necessity of designing each work in turn. The plan would design the work.

In each case, however, the artist would select the basic form and rules that would govern the solution of the problem.

/home/mackenza/notes/massumi_too_blue.md:The event lies at the intersection of at least two (and in reality many more) process lines.

/home/mackenza/notes/sassens_networks_state_2000.md:When it comes to the Internet’s capacity to undermine state authority and the state’s capacity to regulate the Internet, two issues stand out in my reading. One is that the state has instruments through which it can exercise a certain kind of authority, especially through the venue of technical standards in the hardware and software, through the protection of property rights and, quite likely, through some of the features of the Internet addressing system and domain registry. The second is that much of the work of developing the instruments through which the state can exercise this authority is dominated by a limited number of countries, and, in some aspects, largely by the US, certainly until recently. This leaves most states in the world in the position of having to implement and enforce standards and property rights developed elsewhere if various digital networks in their countries are going to be connected to the Internet, which they mostly are already today. 29
