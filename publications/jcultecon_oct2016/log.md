- looked at submission guidelines http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjce20&page=instructions#mp_style
- might need to shorten a bit to get under 8000 words -- seems ok
- moved files from sss to here -- abstract.md, figures, ref_bibs, and number_jcult_econ.rmd
- also looked through marcus article on ethnography as prototyping and put it in zotero data_forms as well as ~/archive/marcus_Prototyping and Contemporary Anthropological Experiments With Ethnographic Method_2012.pdf
