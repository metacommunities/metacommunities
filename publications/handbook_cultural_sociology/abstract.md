Digital sociology faces the task of making sense of a field of devices that generate cultural saturated feedback loops between platforms, identities, places and forms of inclusion and belonging. We suggest in this entry that digital sociology could respond to this challenge by doing device-specific research in the field of devices. Some aspects of that challenge come to light in the practices of making devices as seen in software development, where constant transformations, variations and recombinations of code projects suggests something much more like a relational field than well-ordered production or circulation of objects.
