## intro

Much of digital sociology focuses on culture as it plays out in a vast, expanding, power-laden and complex textual and media environments that have taken shape in the last few decades. The object of analysis is digital culture, or culture as it is re-written digitally. The methods are digital in an increasingly wide variety of ways.

## the organisation of attempts to study culture at scale: individual, smartness, massiveness
## these attempts constitute their own cultures/environments that need to be studied

how to study them: look at flow of texts; look at flows of readers; look at flow of practices (Marres), including algorithms (D. Mackenzie), libraries, visual forms (Burrows); and especially writing and reading practices of data (us);

    ### flow of practices across groups
