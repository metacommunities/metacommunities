- looked at submission guidelines http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjce20&page=instructions#mp_style
- might need to shorten a bit to get under 8000 words -- seems ok
- moved files from sss to here -- abstract.md, figures, ref_bibs, and number_jcult_econ.rmd
- also looked through marcus article on ethnography as prototyping and put it in zotero data_forms as well as ~/archive/marcus_Prototyping and Contemporary Anthropological Experiments With Ethnographic Method_2012.pdf

- need a todo list for this paper -- that might mean    
    - DONE:printing it
    - DONE:read the sss reports
    - TODO:cutting it down to size
    - TODO:updating some of the methods talk
    - TODO:bringing in some of the new queries and diagrams I've done
    - TODO:adding a few notes on the massive ddos
- ok, formatting for printing -- not so easy! and printed it
- TODO: work out a good title
- DONE: check out recent jcultecon papers -- the virtual si on digital is good starting point http://explore.tandfonline.com/page/ah/journal-of-cultural-economy-digital-world; should refer to articles by Marres & Fish, and possibly some of the stuff on markets; e.g. Callon or Deville on attachments? 
- Did a search on number, which led to quite a lot of results, but nothing related particularly to the re-counting work I'm proposing. How can I narrow this down? If this was a contribution to STS, then how would keep the method stuff. But JCE, it seems like the attachment, affective, re-counting, etc ideas would be better. In that case, however, where does the counting work I suggest fit? Is counting a method we should adopt more?     
- initial thoughts are that I should reorder the paper a bit in this order:
    1. prominence of the number, including multiple ddos, venture capital, media
    2. notion of configuration as a way of making sense of this 
- But I could also just read the reports, revise and submit to STS

- having second thoughts about sts journal submission. Might be better fit with jcultecon, but keep the methodology discussion more in the background as a piece for a methods journal. 
- started editing paper version with a view to JCE. Will need to edit about 33 pages, so 12/day ...  
- actually read the reports, which was hard, but probably worthwhile. Maybe the sss paper was just too confusing and perhaps not saying much about the numbers ...  But ref 4 didn't think that, and that is the most engaged review. 
- TODO: write much more simply about what happens on gh or at least, say why it is not possible to do that. Could also talk about how Github added to an existing practice, and re-configured it as a social network practice; 
- TODO: write about data challenges as pre-competitive competitions that valorise the numbers and the data. 
- TODO: decide what to do about Badiou -- does it help or not ... I like the idea of fragments of a multiplicity; and the idea might be that capital numbers always fragment multiples. 
- could have a go at re-writing the abstract, see if that helps me decide what to do about the numbers ... DONE in abstract.md 
- TODO: put small section about how capital numbers figure in social media more generally and suggest why github is an interesting case (people + things; recursive). 
- looking at internet archive pages for Github and can see where numbers first began to appear -- seems to be around 75k in 2008. By end of 2010, people and repositories are lists: 440k people hosting over 1.3 million repos. Interesting that people host repos ...
- TODO: 1 for \$0.50; 12 for \$1.00; 144 for \$1.50: what can you buy in a hardware store?

- read up to the conclusion in the print out. Have been cutting quite a lot of the theory -- no Tarde? No Latour? 
- have identified a couple of places where more could be added and perhaps new minianalysis undertaken. For instance, non-code repos -- if there are 10M of them, what is happening there ..

 - finally getting back to this -- spent last 3-4 weeks on facebook paper. Could I convert this paper, in the context of the 'obscure central zone' into a methods chapter for the obscure central zones project? maybe would be ok to do that. 
 - after reading so much Simondon, find myself reframing the paper in terms of configuration and technical ensembles. I've rewritten the abstract -- see abstract.md 2nd-version
 - Abstract: feel like this new abstract will help a bit. 
 - DONE: set up the new blank file and start bringing bits into it. 
 - TODO: add notes to Simondon file on obscure central zone of technical ensemble -- this will come mainly from the conclusion; 
 - changed the title include configurations and technical ensemble

## Tue Dec  6 10:25:41 GMT 2016

- find it hard to start work Tue Dec  6 10:36:03 GMT 2016 as the time shows.
- feel better about the obscure central zone thing, but TODO: go through the manuscript and mark all the bits of the paper that would fit that approach. In some ways, its just a re-framing of the configuration argument.   
- but to re-write in that way will mean a new paper basically. Unless I can bring the two together -- the tightest focus on this would be to say that the capital numbers tend to compress the middle zone into what can be known from the perspective of property and work.  The data visualizations and the big data treatments try to address the assemble but are constantly realigned to the realities of capital and work. 
- what if infrastructures have been a bit of a distraction for engagements with the technical ensemble? The technicity of the ensemble does not lie in infrastructures. It resides, as Simondon says, in combines or inter-commutativity.  
- Tue Dec  6 12:13:26 GMT 2016 -- almost 2 hours later -- haven't done much on the paper, instead went three first 3 chapters of _Learning Javascript_ to get some sense of what is happening with Javascript, jquery, node, etc. Not sure that is very useful for focusing here.  
- DONE: bring 1000 words across from previous version
- ALMOST DONE: write a new intro that puts technical ensemble ahead of the number practice. 
- github/about now says 48 million projects: DONE: put into title?
