## Mon 10 Oct 14:45:55 BST 2016
- looked at submission guidelines http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjce20&page=instructions#mp_style
- might need to shorten a bit to get under 8000 words -- seems ok
- moved files from sss to here -- abstract.md, figures, ref_bibs, and number_jcult_econ.rmd
- also looked through marcus article on ethnography as prototyping and put it in zotero data_forms as well as ~/archive/marcus_Prototyping and Contemporary Anthropological Experiments With Ethnographic Method_2012.pdf

## Fri 4 Nov 09:35:29 GMT 2016
- DONE:printing it - ok, formatting for printing -- not so easy! and printed it
- DONE:read the sss reports
- DONE:cutting it down to size
- MUSTDONE:updating some of the methods talk
- TODO:bringing in some of the new queries and diagrams I've done
- DONE:adding a few notes on the massive ddos
- DONE: work out a good title
- DONE: check out recent jcultecon papers -- the virtual si on digital is good starting point http://explore.tandfonline.com/page/ah/journal-of-cultural-economy-digital-world; should refer to articles by Marres & Fish, and possibly some of the stuff on markets; e.g. Callon or Deville on attachments? 
- Did a search on number, which led to quite a lot of results, but nothing related particularly to the re-counting work I'm proposing. How can I narrow this down? If this was a contribution to STS, then how would keep the method stuff. But JCE, it seems like the attachment, affective, re-counting, etc ideas would be better. In that case, however, where does the counting work I suggest fit? Is counting a method we should adopt more?     
- initial thoughts are that I should reorder the paper a bit in this order:
    1. prominence of the number, including multiple ddos, venture capital, media
    2. notion of configuration as a way of making sense of this 
- But I could also just read the reports, revise and submit to STS 

## Mon 7 Nov 09:09:05 GMT 2016
- having second thoughts about sts journal submission. Might be better fit with jcultecon, but keep the methodology discussion more in the background as a piece for a methods journal. 
- started editing paper version with a view to JCE. Will need to edit about 33 pages, so 12/day ...  
- actually read the reports, which was hard, but probably worthwhile. Maybe the sss paper was just too confusing and perhaps not saying much about the numbers ...  But ref 4 didn't think that, and that is the most engaged review. 
- DONE: write much more simply about what happens on gh or at least, say why it is not possible to do that. Could also talk about how Github added to an existing practice, and re-configured it as a social network practice; 
- DONE: write about data challenges as pre-competitive competitions that valorise the numbers and the data. 
- DONE: decide what to do about Badiou -- does it help or not ... I like the idea of fragments of a multiplicity; and the idea might be that capital numbers always fragment multiples. 
- could have a go at re-writing the abstract, see if that helps me decide what to do about the numbers ... DONE in abstract.md 
- DONE: put small section about how capital numbers figure in social media more generally and suggest why github is an interesting case (people + things; recursive). 
- looking at internet archive pages for Github and can see where numbers first began to appear -- seems to be around 75k in 2008. By end of 2010, people and repositories are lists: 440k people hosting over 1.3 million repos. Interesting that people host repos ...
- DONE: 1 for \$0.50; 12 for \$1.00; 144 for \$1.50: what can you buy in a hardware store? 

## Tue 8 Nov 12:21:58 GMT 2016
- read up to the conclusion in the print out. Have been cutting quite a lot of the theory -- no Tarde? No Latour? 
- have identified a couple of places where more could be added and perhaps new minianalysis undertaken. For instance, non-code repos -- if there are 10M of them, what is happening there .. 

## Mon 5 Dec 11:41:13 GMT 2016
- finally getting back to this -- spent last 3-4 weeks on facebook paper. Could I convert this paper, in the context of the 'obscure central zone' into a methods chapter for the obscure central zones project? maybe would be ok to do that. 
- after reading so much Simondon, find myself reframing the paper in terms of configuration and technical ensembles. I've rewritten the abstract -- see abstract.md 2nd-version
- Abstract: feel like this new abstract will help a bit. 
- DONE: set up the new blank file and start bringing bits into it. 
- DONE: add notes to Simondon file on obscure central zone of technical ensemble -- this will come mainly from the conclusion; 
- changed the title include configurations and technical ensemble

## Tue 6 Dec 10:25:41 GMT 2016
- find it hard to start work Tue Dec  6 10:36:03 GMT 2016 as the time shows.
- feel better about the obscure central zone thing, but DONE: go through the manuscript and mark all the bits of the paper that would fit that approach. In some ways, its just a re-framing of the configuration argument.   
- but to re-write in that way will mean a new paper basically. Unless I can bring the two together -- the tightest focus on this would be to say that the capital numbers tend to compress the middle zone into what can be known from the perspective of property and work.  The data visualizations and the big data treatments try to address the assemble but are constantly realigned to the realities of capital and work. 
- what if infrastructures have been a bit of a distraction for engagements with the technical ensemble? The technicity of the ensemble does not lie in infrastructures. It resides, as Simondon says, in combines or inter-commutativity.  
- Tue Dec  6 12:13:26 GMT 2016 -- almost 2 hours later -- haven't done much on the paper, instead went three first 3 chapters of _Learning Javascript_ to get some sense of what is happening with Javascript, jquery, node, etc. Not sure that is very useful for focusing here.  
- DONE: bring 1000 words across from previous version
- ALMOST DONE: write a new intro that links technical ensemble ahead of the number practice. 
- github/about now says 48 million projects: DONE: put into title?

## Wed 7 Dec 10:42:48 GMT 2016
- trying to start again today -- late start; have done some notes on MEOT conclusion in simondon_mode_tech_1989.md . A couple of them are about the obscure central zone, but this mainly relates to the work argument. Is that enough?   
- too busy to get much done. But trying to bring in the next section of around 1000 words to introduce the notion of configurative and capital numbers.  
- ok, brought across the notion of capital number, so that is there 
- DONE: bring the section on configurative numbers as riposte.

## Thu 8 Dec 09:29:21 GMT 2016
- distracted by javascript stuff -- see repo on reveal.js. But what I've learned from this is how close code is to the surface of things. It's not hidden away in some developers machine, its there, right behind CTRL-U on the webpage, and its doing much more. 
- still doing a lot of pfaffing with reveal, impress.js -- playing with presentation formats. That's because it's hard to do what I need to do .. which is bring in the stuff on configurative numbers ...  
- maybe would be good to bring in the configurative number stuff much later as 'the answer.'
- got the part of the manuscript introducing the event -- reintroduced it in terms of ensembles, and git itself as vcs. Add a new json event and used some of the existing text to describe
- DONE: bring in the section that describes the relation between the event and the capital number. 

## Fri 9 Dec 09:55:55 GMT 2016
- moving to th Github data challenges and visualizations, etc. 
- brought across table 1 and the counts of the data; found myself bringing more commentary from  Github blogs etc to help make sense of what is going on with the counting. 
- brought across all the data challenge stuff, putting some in footnotes. That brings things to about 4k words (wo references). Looking at my re-counting to see what that does next. Does it help? 

## Mon 12 Dec 09:28:02 GMT 2016
- worried about turning to my own counts -- this is not meant to be a methods paper, yet it risks doing that if it goes with the counting too much. 
- DONE  I haven't brought in configurative numbers yet, and that needs to be done. And it feels more substantial than just a methods piece ...  
- wrote a section on configurative enumerations -- does that need to be put at the centre of things? Not convinced by it -- see line 144 -- because it seems like the capital number, which is a single number, is now treated like an ensemble.  Included the hardware store riddle, which helped. 
- brought in the first figure and talked about it in more detail. Hopefully the triviality of the name counting won't be lost too much; but I can strengthen it a bit. Feel better after starting to re-write it a bit. 
- DONE: begin conclusion by talking about the conversion from capital numbers to configurative enumerations. 

## Tue 13 Dec 09:06:50 GMT 2016

- nervous about resuming with this, because this is where I actually have to say something useful. ... 
- wrote about the forks a bit and then ran rmarkdown html a couple of times to see how whether it works. Then got distracted by stuff about journals ...  
- also did the bootstrap and android fork figures, and tried to frame theme as commutative processes in the technical ensemble. Not sure good that is, but have now set up the next section on 'the generalization of configuration' I want to say -- what if most of what is going on here is configuration ... that configuration is becoming a primary technical process, because it is the main form of concretisation that technical ensembles require today... 
- suggests what I'm doing more generally in this paper is taking maximum, critical, extreme, outlier, typical and counter-intuitive cases as the basis for recounting. 
- DONE: bring in eclipse and dot repos as final examples -- they are the final section of the capital numbers; having done that, now re-writing to say less and more.
- DONE: finish the discussion of dotfiles with the point that the implicit configuration work is much wider than this; and that it is this work that allows the ensemble to take on consistency, etc.  

## Wed 14 Dec 11:11:41 GMT 2016
- just starting now due to other stuff. Can I swing this dotfile/configuration stuff around to the technical ensemble enough? Feel like I'm drawing a long bow here ...
- have written a bit about dotfile stuff, not sure how good it is. MUSTDONE: check dotfile discussion makes sense
- DONE: bring bits of the conclusion in if they are any good
- DONE: rewrite conclusion

## Mon 19 Dec 2016 09:47:29 GMT
- didn't realise how little time I'd have. Been busy.   
- hard to get started - don't want to look at the conclusion because I'm not I've said anything that could lead to a conclusion. Finding it hard to go and get the hard copy out! DONE: get the hardcopy from my bag. 
- I've worked on this for 13 sessions. I guess they are roughly 2 hours each. So 26-30 hours work on it so far. Yikes, seems a lot ... 
- looking at the conclusion from sss paper -- not sure if there is much I can use. 
- brought some of the conclusion in. And working on saying what I think about Github.   
- DONE: try to write something about the specificity of Github in this project. 
- MUSTDO: add in some broadly relevant literature -- Bratton on stack; Suchman on re-configuration, Gillespie et al on media; perhaps something on infrastructure -- from handbook! 
- DONE: add in idea that Github is no mere example  -- the fact that we know little of it despite its importance suggests something more is going on

## Tue 20 Dec 10:10:16 GMT 2016
- lined up a set of books on my shelves at home -- kelty, coleman, suchman, gillespie, lazarratto, bratton, bryant, -- and could extend with Latour (aramis), and a few others like Bowker. These are meant to address the todo from yesterday. How much effort?   Read Lucy on configuration; or reconfiguration -- its quite hard to pin her down  on what configuration does ... But it would be a good readership to have in mind.  
- I've put some references in the introduction to that list;
- found myself re-ordering the introduction to put the number back at the top. Otherwise I have to highlight the technical ensemble right throughout. 
- DONE: the introduction needs re-shaping to flow better - start from HERE in file i.e. line 32
- MUSTDONE: write a note saying that it would be possible to work with other identifiers; 
 
## Mon 09 Jan 2017 11:08:03 GMT
- starting work for the first time this year, but not early in the morning -- great to have these notes to work from, because its hard to remember what I was meant to be saying. 
- slightly daunting todo list -- not sure how many of these I can do. Also I can't remember how polished the paper is. 

## Tue 10 Jan 2017 09:22:47 GMT
- merged big data ethnography chapter to get scripts for plots.  
- extracted a list of todos to help me look at what needs to be done. Here's the line:
grep 'MUSTDO' % > mustdo.md
- working on the introduction again -- it seems clunky because it moves between number and technical ensemble. What can I do about that?
- DONE: align the conclusion with the introduction

## Wed 11 Jan 2017 09:15:50 GMT
- hard to start today ...working on the conclusion, checking it maps onto the introduction.   
-reordered the conclusion quite a lot and think its ok. Also re-did the abstract in the same vein. 
-DONE: go through the rest of the todos marking key ones ... 

## Thu 12 Jan 2017 09:20:40 GMT
- configuration in Suchman's sense comes together with figure in numeric sense; suggesting that figures can have volume, density, surface, curve together with other things; this is what configurative enumerations might do ... thicken numbers, explore their graphic folds. 
- went through the TODOs and either did them or demoted them. Felt that I was getting somewhere when I began to identify configuration with the obscure central zone, the margin of indeterminacy that allows machines to be grouped together. It seems that it might be worth following that a bit more, but not in this paper!
- TODO: fix any missing references

## Wed 18 Jan 2017 10:24:13 GMT
- been working on paper copy this week, doing roughly ten pages a day.

## Thu 19 Jan 2017 09:21:11 GMT
- starting to add paper revisions into text. Again, 10 pages/day
- almost got 10 pages done today; TODO: fix long references in zotero e.g. Marshall

## Fri 20 Jan 2017 15:11:50 GMT
- hoping to get 6 pages down, but starting very late -- only half an hour to do it. 
- did manage to do the 6 pages


## Mon 23 Jan 2017 11:24:16 GMT
- starting 3 hour block on this paper; at page 17 of 40  
- 13:30: finished entering all the corrections; almost ready to send. 
- DONE: fix Wittgenstein reference
- TODO: generate document with references; submit!

## Thu 26 Jan 2017 11:06:23 GMT
-  actually made myself start the submission process - bit of a psy-barrier there. Made some progress. But want to do some other things today as well. So saving halfway through: url - https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rjce

## Fri 27 Jan 2017 14:35:43 GMT
- continuing jcultecon submission; had to fix a couple of references, etc; 
- finally submitted it -- took 90 minutes or so to sort out references, figures, etc. Still not exactly right. 

## Wed 24 May 2017 10:58:32 BST
- got reports back last week and put them here: reports.md 
- starting search on capitalization -- Thrift, Muniesa, etc. Need to get these and add them in. 

## Fri 02 Jun 2017 17:06:14 BST
- read reports again -- they have some major common points. The two outstanding ones are github as a platform and capital numbers/capitalisation. They both want clarification on that.  
- DONE: read the leyshon article ~/archive/ensembles/FS_EarlyView_LangleyLeyshon_2016.pdf 
- Got this quote from it:
    When placing the platform at the centre of critical understandings of digital economic circulation, moreover, we have suggested that the platform is not merely a manifestation of wider transformations in the relations and structures of contemporary capitalism. For us, analytical attention should be given to the contingent configuration and consequences of the platform as a discrete mode of socio-technical intermediary and capitalist business arrangement. 15
- TODO for revision:
    - reframe gh as a platform, but a platform for platform making; 
    - emphasise the configurative numbers as a methodological response, with political and social implications; 
    - read what is meant by capitalisation and position paper as a contribution to that ... 

## Mon 12 Jun 2017 09:37:36 BST
- starting revisions
= doing the search on capitalization on WoS, and getting Thrift-Leyshon 2007 (~/archive/ensembles/leyshon_thrift_capitalization_2007.pdf), Muniesa is the key reference but haven't been able to get many of his papers -- library has book on order at least. (due 26 June)
- can read Munieasa's capitalization devices chapter here: https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vAE7CgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA109&dq=muniesa+fabian&ots=cKsfePV6aT&sig=6JzfWF4RtNW6QmU-Lve6Dep4ppw#v=onepage&q=muniesa%20fabian&f=true
- I took some notes in ~/notes/doganova_muniesa_2015.md and saved reference in zotero
- notes on Thrift-Leyshon in ~/notes/leyshon_thrift_capitalization_2007.md reference also in zotero [@Leyshon_2007] 
- read lanley and leyshon more and add notes to ~/notes/lanley_leyshon_platform_2016.md; it really has quite a lot in it; and summarizes a lot of the existing literature quite well. 
- read through all the abstracts in JCE to get a sense of what readers are into:
    - not a lot on digital; quite a lot on the need to think the cultural -- what actors do; how they make sense; and how it differs from the business model
    - found medium article on github business plan: https://medium.com/@moritzplassnig/github-is-doing-much-better-than-bloomberg-thinks-here-is-why-a4580b249044 and as reference [@Plassnig_2016] 
- Plan of work: 
    - reframe github as a platform, and talk about the configured practices platforms involves; github as a configurative platform; a meta-platform, and a place to see what platforms do; 
    - redo capital numbers in terms of platform and capitalization;
    - present the paper as a contribution to the literature on capitalization, and potentially resisting some of tis more performative readings. 
    - frame what I'm doing in the counting work - is it ok to count? clarify this as deconstructive? more than that -- configurative is a way of paying attention to ground rent, or something similiar ... or perhaps to the movement/circulation; to understand circulation as a matter of configuration ...  
    - add some software studies to justify attention on software
