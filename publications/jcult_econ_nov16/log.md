- looked at submission guidelines http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjce20&page=instructions#mp_style
- might need to shorten a bit to get under 8000 words -- seems ok
- moved files from sss to here -- abstract.md, figures, ref_bibs, and number_jcult_econ.rmd
- also looked through marcus article on ethnography as prototyping and put it in zotero data_forms as well as ~/archive/marcus_Prototyping and Contemporary Anthropological Experiments With Ethnographic Method_2012.pdf

- need a todo list for this paper -- that might mean    
    - DONE:printing it
    - DONE:read the sss reports
    - TODO:cutting it down to size
    - TODO:updating some of the methods talk
    - TODO:bringing in some of the new queries and diagrams I've done
    - TODO:adding a few notes on the massive ddos
- ok, formatting for printing -- not so easy! and printed it
- TODO: work out a good title
- DONE: check out recent jcultecon papers -- the virtual si on digital is good starting point http://explore.tandfonline.com/page/ah/journal-of-cultural-economy-digital-world; should refer to articles by Marres & Fish, and possibly some of the stuff on markets; e.g. Callon or Deville on attachments? 
- Did a search on number, which led to quite a lot of results, but nothing related particularly to the re-counting work I'm proposing. How can I narrow this down? If this was a contribution to STS, then how would keep the method stuff. But JCE, it seems like the attachment, affective, re-counting, etc ideas would be better. In that case, however, where does the counting work I suggest fit? Is counting a method we should adopt more?     
- initial thoughts are that I should reorder the paper a bit in this order:
    1. prominence of the number, including multiple ddos, venture capital, media
    2. notion of configuration as a way of making sense of this 
- But I could also just read the reports, revise and submit to STS

- having second thoughts about sts journal submission. Might be better fit with jcultecon, but keep the methodology discussion more in the background as a piece for a methods journal. 
- started editing paper version with a view to JCE. Will need to edit about 33 pages, so 12/day ...  
- actually read the reports, which was hard, but probably worthwhile. Maybe the sss paper was just too confusing and perhaps not saying much about the numbers ...  But ref 4 didn't think that, and that is the most engaged review. 
- TODO: write much more simply about what happens on gh or at least, say why it is not possible to do that. Could also talk about how Github added to an existing practice, and re-configured it as a social network practice; 
- TODO: write about data challenges as pre-competitive competitions that valorise the numbers and the data. 
- TODO: decide what to do about Badiou -- does it help or not ... I like the idea of fragments of a multiplicity; and the idea might be that capital numbers always fragment multiples. 
- could have a go at re-writing the abstract, see if that helps me decide what to do about the numbers ... DONE in abstract.md 
- TODO: put small section about how capital numbers figure in social media more generally and suggest why github is an interesting case (people + things; recursive). 
- looking at internet archive pages for Github and can see where numbers first began to appear -- seems to be around 75k in 2008. By end of 2010, people and repositories are lists: 440k people hosting over 1.3 million repos. Interesting that people host repos ...
