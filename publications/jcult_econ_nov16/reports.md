Comments to the Author
Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to read this paper. It offers an insightful analysis of a software development platform called Github, and of the ways in which this platform counts itself and could be counted alternatively. The paper develops the notion of “capital numbers” as a form of enumeration that participates in the capitalization of technical ensembles, which I found very suggestive. Reading this paper was thus an inspiring exercise, but also a very difficult one. My main concern with the paper is its lack of clarity, both theoretically and empirically. My suggestion would be to revise the paper with the objective to sharpen the argument and give a richer empirical description of “capital numbers”, which could provide a better grasp for the analysis of the production and the uses of these numbers. The following comments are intended to help in that direction. 

The first difficulty that the reader encounters is Github itself. I was not familiar with Github and probably other readers will be in the same case. We start by learning that Github is a “technical ensemble” that “intensifies (several) tendencies in coding and software development” (p. 4) – but all this remains a bit vague as long as the reader does not have further details on the object that the analysis refers to. The definition itself of Github is important. Doesn’t a depiction of Github a “large technical ensemble” (p. 2) participate in the same move as the production of “capital numbers”? Github is also a (profitable?) company from the point of view of the investor, probably a tool among others from the point of view of the user, or a community animated by a certain ideology… Later on, the paper refers to a number of things that one can find on or make with Github (repositories, events, workflows, actions, queries, forks…) – all these are difficult to apprehend without some background knowledge about what this is all about. 

The second difficulty relates to the definition of capital numbers, which remains a bit elusive and triggers a series of questions: 
•       The numbers that Github mobilizes to describe itself (48 million “projects”, 18 million “people”) are defined as “capital numbers” (p. 6). Why? Are all the numbers that Github produces capital numbers, or just these two? 
•       Capital numbers are distinguished from other numbers such as “biopolitical” or “financial” numbers because of the ways in which they “become visible and circulate” (p. 7) – what are these peculiar ways? And what are bioplitical and financial numbers? One could say that the 48 and 18 million numbers are also “biopolitical”, because they enact a “community”, and “financial”, because they enact a “company”, the way accounting numbers serve to designate a total entity that owns a certain number of assets. The question then arises of what kind of entity capital numbers enact. Probably an investment, which has the power to generate future streams of value to those who take a stake in it.  
•       Capital numbers are called “capital” in reference to: capital as a center, capital as in the capital letter of a proper noun, capital as “an accumulated fund with potential to grow” (p. 7). This should be developed and made clearer. I did not quite understand the first: in what ways do capital numbers evoke centrality? May be centrality in terms of being important, or being at the intersection of different flows? The second, if I understand correctly, is that these numbers become attributes of Github, define it in a certain way. The third I found most interesting. These numbers act indeed as “promises (for) further accumulation”. They also circulate in many different settings, define Github’s present attributes and at the same time signal its future development (it is growing), serve to make Github valuable for investors. In this respect, capital numbers might be seen as an instrument for capitalization – it might be interesting to discuss this point in relation to the emerging literature on “capitalization” (Doganova and Muniesa 2015, Birch 2016, Leyshon and Thrift 2007, Muniesa et al. 2016). 
All this needs to be made clearer and, most importantly, to be better related to the empirical analysis that follows:
•       How are these numbers produced, is an important question. The paper explains what are the “projects” that amount to 48 million. If I understand correctly, the category of “event” is crucial here. All this seemed interesting, but I must confess that I was lost, probably because of the lack of some background knowledge on Github, as I mentioned above. It would also be interesting to make a similar analysis for the other capital number, the “people” who amount to 18 million. 
•       Is 289,195,208, the number in which results the counting of events (p. 10-11), a capital number? I was not quite sure who is doing this form of counting: Github or the author? And with what purpose? 
•       Same question for the numbers produced at the “Data Challenges”: are these capital numbers and why? It would be important for the argument to specify each time whether, and most importantly in what ways, the numbers that the paper discusses are capital numbers as defined above. Take the example of the numbers produced by the tool called Open Source Report Card which profiles users. They could be seen as capital in at least two ways: as attributes that define the identity of people (the comparison with the CV is illuminating in this respect), and as nurturing processes of capitalization (as the paper mentions, these numbers can be part of getting work). But to make this point, the paper should say more about what these numbers look like, and how they are used. Probably they are quite different from the 48 and 18 million discussed above: smaller, less visible (e.g., can potential employers see them?), less circulating (are they attached to a user’s name and circulate with it?). Same remarks on the other examples from the “Data Challenges”; it was less clear to me in what sense the numbers produced in those cases were capital. 

The third difficulty relates to the “configurative enumeration” part of the paper. Several ambiguities here:
•       Is “configurative enumeration” an alternative to the production of capital numbers (as the abstract seems to suggest), or a different “sense” that could be given to capital numbers, a different “angle” from which they can be seen, as the paper suggests when introducing this notion (p. 17)? 
•       The difference between numbers which totalize and capitalize, on the one hand, and enumeration and re-counting, on the other hand, is easy to grasp: one could say that enumeration is about opening the black box of capital numbers, shedding light on the elements that compose them, questioning the “equivalence conventions” (Desrosieres 1993) on which they rely. The “configurative” part of it was less clear to me. What does it mean to “configure through enumeration”, how is it different from other processes of configuration? And how can this be seen in the examples discussed? What is configured there? I see these examples rather as attempts at deconstructing the capital numbers produced by Github. 
•       Who is doing the re-counting? If I understand correctly, it is the author, with the purpose of “re-scaling” the 48 million number by showing that a large part of these 48 million  repositories are “ephemeral” or derive from “copies” or “commutations” (I did not fully understand the analysis of copies and commutations, once again probably because of the lack of background knowledge). One wonders what this is supposed to show. That the 48 million number is not a true reflection of what is actually happening at Github? That the re-counting gives “a better sense of the ensemble-realities” (p. 23)? Sociological analysis of numbers would rather avoid such questions, because deciding about which numbers are better entails deciding what better means and who is in position to define it. Sociological analysis would rather look at how the numbers we observe are produced, what they do in practice, how they are mobilized by actors or contested. In this respect, it might be interesting to know whether the 18 and 48 million numbers are challenged (for example Github’s competitors, if there are any), and whether alternative enumerations are produced not only by the author, but also by other actors, and with what purpose.

Comments to the Author

This paper explores the important but understudied works of digital coding repositories that act as important sites within contemporary digital infrastructure.  Through a study of the GitHub repository it introduces two concepts that are likely to have wider traction within the cultural economy literature: capital numbers and configurative enumerations.  The former are numbers that are associated with phenomena in order to signal their significance and, crucially, attract investment to fund them.  The latter is the effort to more closely interrogate the formation of such numbers, which in the spirit of ANT and SST, opens up the ‘black box’ to reveal that all is not what it seems.  This act of revelation is particularly important in the technological field, due to the high level of complexity and technical opacity, which keep much of its internal works away from public scrutiny.

This paper has the potential to make an important contribution, but needs more work to really deliver.  Part of what needs to be done is to make the subject more accessible to a non-technical audience, for at times the authors seems captured by the narrative style of the community that s/he is studying.  Greater clarity would help connect the paper to a wider critical audience, and make better links to wider literatures and debates.  

The main task in rewriting the paper is to properly incorporate the growing work on capitalisation within the paper.  Capitalisation is mentioned, but not really explained, and yet there is a growing body of work on the centrality of this process to contemporary capitalisms. For example, see the recent work by Fabien Muniesa and colleagues, and the older work of Leyshon and Thrift.  The ability of technology companies to hail venture capital through the promise of capitalisation is a critical part of the rise of technological assembles.  The author is aware of this, I’m sure, but that connection to existing work needs to be made.
More also needs to be done to explain what to the author seems obvious: you need to take general JCE readers with you.  There is more to be said about the rise of coding and hacking, and you need to say more about the sociology of forking.  This is critical within the evolution of open source, for example, which is an important cognate coding community for Github.  Github itself needs more context and explanation.  It remains far too obscure in this paper.  For example, on page 4, you argue that “Github … is a typical technical ensemble because it intensifies all of these tendencies in coding and software development”.  This is an assertion.  It would be useful to know how it does this. There is a need to expand and illustrate. A brief history of open source and hacker communities would also help explain the phenomena of collaborative coding at large scale, which is central to GitHub.  Weber’s 2004 book on The Politics of Open Source would be a good place to start. 

The paper raises the issue of the geography of code, but this falls rather flat.  This is potentially interesting, but either has to be developed or dropped from the paper.  Is there a pattern? Is there evidence of agglomeration? It might be instructive to look at the work of Matt Zook, for example, on the geography of the internet.  But cutting this would create space for the additional material that I have suggested above. 

In summary, potentially this could be a significant very well cited paper, but it needs a through revision. I look forward to seeing the final version in due course.
