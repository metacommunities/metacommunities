 Platforms are at the centre of debates around value, property, work, identity and subjectivity in digital culture. What are platforms?  Nick Srnicek's _Technology After Capitalism_ for instance, defines platforms as 'digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact' [@Srnicek_2016, 25].  Economists such as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson understand platforms as 'a digital environment characterized by near zero marginal cost of access, reproduction and distribution'[@McAfee_2017, 137]. Neither Srnicek or McAfee focus on the making of platforms. They view them from the perspective of business models, assets and ownership rather than in terms of an ongoing process of development and organization. The ongoing making of platforms, or the _platformizing_ practices, do not figure much (or even at all) in these  accounts, even as they stress the centrality of platforms to 'our digital future' [@McAfee_2017].
