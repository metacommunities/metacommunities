Dear Editors
Thanks very much for the second round of readers' reports and your advice on further revisions. In the new revision of the manuscript I've worked on the main points you suggested as well as few others that appeared in the reports. The tracked changes document indicates the extent of this work.

1. I've focused on clarifying the terminology -- platform, platformizing, configuration. They are key elements of the analysis, so it was good to have my attention directed towards them. I've removed terminology -- post-performative for instance -- that might distract or confuse readers.
2. I've added more of the 2016-2017 literature on platforms. I have positioned the paper in the introduction as a contribution to the emerging platform debates. Wherever possible, I have streamlined, simplified or just tried to speak more plainly. You will see the traces of this throughout the manuscript. 
3. Many small corrections and changes to grammar and wording for the purpose of readability and reduction of 'constitutive opacity' of the text.

What I didn't manage to do:

1. Reviewer 1 asked about 'enumeration.' I have a broader hunch about numbering and what is happening to numbers at the moment. But I don't have space to develop that here. So this remains a weak point in the analysis. I welcome suggestions on how to deal with it. 
2. Reviewer 1 asked me to draw out more the links between 'evolutionary soup' of  Github and capitalist business models.  I couldn't do it. I thought I'd gone quite a long way in this paper already in that direction. But if its not making sense, I could have another go.
