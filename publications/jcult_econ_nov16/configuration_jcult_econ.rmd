## Abstract

Platforms are important actors in contemporary cultural economic processes.
Platforms include social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication infrastructures,  supply chain logistics management solutions, and cryptocurrency systems.
This paper argues that analysis of platforms and their capitalization should take into account both the ways they structure social practice as assets and the constitutive opacity of platforms as configured realities.
It explores this opacity by focusing on the problems  of counting people and things on platforms. 
Via a case study of the software code repository platform [Github.com](https://github.com), it analyzes how the counting of 'platform numbers'  participates  in their capitalization. 
It describes attempts to enumerate the elements of the platform by counting, mapping or listing them in the form of large numbers.
The paper shows how attempts to enumerate people and things encounter unstable aggregates, forms of association, duplication, combination, imitation and configuration that are crucial to the ensemble but remain refractory to asset-structuring capitalization and its enactments.
It proposes  configurative enumeration of the platform numbers as a way of conceptualizing these un-enacted excesses.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and the constant relating, tuning, repairing and adjusting of configurations crucial to the ongoing formation of platforms come into view.
Configurative enumerations engages the inventive realities of platformization, realities that precede and sometimes overflow their capitalization. 
 
## Introduction

This paper describes and theorises a single large number, currently standing at 48 million. '48 million' is a numbering  of the code repositories on the social media platform Github. In complex ways, the  number is a threat that connects what happens on  Github (coding or software development: 'Github is how people build software' as Github rather tersely puts it [@Github_2015]) to  what happens on platforms more generally.

Platforms, as many authors [@Gillespie_2010; @VanDijck_2013a; @Lovink_2015; @Plantin_2016;  @Langley_2016; @Srnicek_2016, @McAfee_2017] have suggested,  stand at the centre of the processes of economic and cultural life. What are platforms?  Nick Srnicek's _Platform Capitalism_ for instance, defines platforms as 'digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact' [@Srnicek_2016, 25]. Srnicek proceeds to categorise platforms according types:  advertising, cloud, industrial, product, and lean (49).    Economists such as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson understand platforms as 'a digital environment characterized by near zero marginal cost of access, reproduction and distribution' [@McAfee_2017, 137]. Their account in _Machine, Platform, Crowd_ is strongly oriented to the economically disruptive development of platforms.   

Neither Srnicek or McAfee focus on the making of platforms. They view them from the perspective of business models, assets and ownership rather than in terms of an ongoing process of development and organization. The ongoing making of platforms, or the _platformizing_ practices, do not figure much (or even at all) in these  accounts, even as they stress the centrality of platforms to 'our digital future' [@McAfee_2017]. The singularity of Github is that it is a platform where platforms are assembled and configured. Many of the most well-known platform are themselves interwoven with code drawn from Github and the like.

Large numbers such as Github's `48 million` present a cultural-analytical artefact of  the dynamism of technical platforms. They attest to 'the scope and range of an operation that typically connects distant situations and configures large social realities' [@Muniesa_2017, 17]. The associative, imitative and often highly layered fabric of technical platforms gives rises to series of such numbers, numbers that have important sociotechnological functions. Large  technical  or 'tech' platforms often figure their growth using such numbers.  We need only think of the prominence of Facebook with its reported 1.9 billion users [@Statista_2017].   These numbers enter into calculative devices such as business models and their financialization. They influence how  work, sociality, political  or cultural life are felt, debated and analyzed. The numbers are highly enacted in the sense that acts of stating them, presenting, monitoring, and comparing  their changes matter to many actors.      

Large technical platforms, however, depend on processes of concretisation and abstraction, and distributed operational realities, that cannot be easily enumerated or conceptualised.[^38.1] These dependencies are both central to platformization -- the process of rendering an ensemble as a platform -- and capitalization -- the process of re-configuring a given setting as a site of accumulation, growth and revenue [@Muniesa_2017]. Platform analysis has highlighted the entanglement of capitalization and platformization.

With respect to capitalization,  platforms emerge and endure through the conversion of hitherto intangible or uncontrolled social processes into potential asset streams. As Liliana Doganova and Fabian Muniesa argue, following Andrew Leyshon and Nigel Thrift's earlier work [@Leyshon_2007], capitalization transforms a 'technology into an _asset_ that has the power to generate a steady stream of future cash flows, that is, into capital' [@Doganova_2015,110]. In many platforms, the constructed asset will largely comprise the dynamics or behaviours of social networks, or what Nathan Tcaz and Geert Lovink term 'the platformed masses' [@Lovink_2015, 14]. 

On the platformization front, matters are slightly different. While capitalization as a process includes any 'any system for aggregating ground rents into a mass', platformization typically engineers specific forms of connection. Platformizing refers to the process of making platforms by placing people and things in specific kinds of relations. Platformizing configures people and things in constantly varying and experimentally modulated relations. If much recent literature on platforms tends to treat platforms as fully accomplished or completely built, the idea of platformizing shifts the emphasis to their ongoing genesis.  As Langley and Leyshon conclude, 'the platform is not merely a manifestation of wider transformations in the relations and structures of contemporary capitalism' [@Langley_2016, 15]. 'Analytical attention,' they suggest,  'should be given to the contingent configuration and consequences of the platform as a discrete mode of socio-technical intermediary and capitalist business arrangement' (15).

[^38.1]:  Concepts of infrastructure [@Star_1996], sociotechnological project [@Latour_1996], global assemblage [@Ong_2005],  configuration [@Suchman_2006],  interface [@Marres_2015], machinic assemblage [@Lazzarato_2014], and more recently, 'stack' [@Bratton_2016]  probe specific aspects of the highly mutable combinations of  machines, signs, people, platforms, tools, processes of invention, practices of work, technical, geographical, social and energetic materialities comprising platforms. The ensemble reality of platforms remains, it seems to me, difficult to analytically conceptualise. 

The difficulty of engaging with  platform capitalization has deep roots. If the philosopher Gilbert Simondon is right, technological cultures have increasingly arranged collections of technical elements such as tools and machines in *ensembles* that existing conceptual framings such as tool, machine, device, or system struggle to hold on to  [@Simondon_1989, 81]. Platforms certainly have many machine elements. (Much of the recent work on algorithms and algorithmic cultures could be seen as responding to the effects of machine-populated platforms; see [@Hallinan_2014]).  Platforms, however, cannot be explained in terms of machines or technologies, because they cohere in a ways that have not yet been fully conceptualised. The term _configuration_ might go some way in addressing this difficulty.

Configuration, as Lucy Suchman suggests [@Suchman_2012], concerns both the technical arrangements and significance of platforms.  A configuration refers first of all the composition and joining of technical elements. Comprised of largely generic commodity hardware and widely circulated software elements, the ensemble reality or specific texture and composition of platforms inheres in its configuration. Configurations in this sense range from technical details such as the specific key shortcuts a software developer sets up in their code editor to the broad architecture of  data-flows between  database,  web-server, and mobile messaging system in a high-volume social media platform. Configuration also refers, much less overtly but directly, to the narration of the significance of platforms. The senses of configuration -- composition and narration -- play out together, at least for some of the actors concerned. If we are interested in both the composition and significance of platforms, then configurative analysis, with its entwining of technical practice and narratives of significance might be valuable. As I will suggest, despite their seeming remoteness from   operational realities,  platform numbers such as '48 million' offer scope for sociological engagement with the configurative realities of platforms.

## Platformizing practice

If technical platforms do have a configured reality that overflows tool, machine, capital or labour, how would we engage with it sociologically? Given that technical platforms as such cannot be radically novel (since they  aggregate, arrange, concretise, group and connect existing technical elements), how are they made? How are machines, technologies, tools and networks platformized?

Github lies at the heart of contemporary platformizing practice. On Github, a social network layer of programmers is immersed in  making platforms. Github is a platformizing platform, or a hub of platformizing practice. Its mundane operational reality concerns how platforms (amongst other things; laws, recipes, plans, policies, scientific articles, books, etc. can also be found there) are made, maintained and deployed. Github  documents, directly and indirectly, platformizing processes.

Platformization depends on programming. Coding practices have changed over the last decade or so in  ways  profoundly entangled with technical platforms. First, coding has shifted away from  relatively closed proprietary machine-centred software development (the kind epitomised by Microsoft Windows or IBM mainframe software during the latter part of last century [@Campbell-Kelly_2004; @Ensmenger_2010]) to a much more legally and technically open,  de-centralized practice of varying scope threaded across  communication and network infrastructures.[^19.1]  An explosion of digital devices and infrastructures, ranging from proliferating mobile devices and sensors to mushrooming data centres,  have widened the reach and variety of coding. The lines and borders separating the production, distribution, and operation of code in technical platforms have thoroughly blurred. Code flows in much more diverse ways through infrastructures and devices. For instance, 'devops' (development-operations) moves constantly revised code directly into operational platforms through continuous deployments, often directly from code repositories on sites such as Github [@Mackenzie_2016b].  Similarly, the geography of coding work still centres on well-established urban centres such as San Francisco and London [@Mackenzie_2016], but by virtue of the networked distribution of coding tools and skills, occurs in many other places as well.

Across all of these changes, coding has become a much more *public* economic and cultural activity (see [@Kelty_2008]), and participation in coding  has become a major concern for business, art,  government and science, albeit for different reasons (for instance, in scientific work, open data has been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of techniques, resources and tools for publishing code written for scientific purposes; for instance, in the many attempts to train school students and others to code as a putative 'basic life skill'). These tendencies in coding work, all of which traverse and structure Github itself, merit much closer attention. They signal some of the complexities involved in contemporary technical platforms. 

[^19.1]: I don't address in any depth here the discourses of free and open software that were so vital and prominent in the constitution of social media platforms as a relational, connective sociality. See [@Mackenzie_2006; @Coleman_2012] for discussion of these discourses. 

## Platform numbers and aggregating practices

Github, we might say, is a typical technical platform because it intensifies all of these tendencies and tensions around the ensemble, distribution, and publicness/participation in coding practice. Github started in in late 2007 and has since become a hub of coding. Like some other social media platforms, it has grown tremendously in the last ten years. Github's growth flows from a variety of processes that are difficult to summarise or classify partly because the actors, topics or domains of coding are so diverse. At first glance, it appears as an online file store where, initially for free, coders can publish, store and find code. But much of what flows through Github is meant to be technically and socially 'innovative' in the sense that Bruno Latour uses the term: '" innovative" means that we do not know the number of actors involved in advance' [@Latour_1996, 72]. As we will see, the growth of Github has many facets.   Such growth is not incidental or extrinsic to platform capitalization. As [@Doganova_2015] argues, the capitalizing devices at work in many platforms predicate growth as the asset or resource that supports revenue streams. Capitalization by definition turns things into assets [@Muniesa_2017, 12].  While online code repositories have existed for several decades (most famously [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net) or [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com)),  which has closed and migrated to Github), more recent code repository platforms such as Github, [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), attempt to encompass a much wider domain of distributed, participatory and public coding practice. They tend to invite and promote collaborative coding as a social networked practice, with all the appurtenances of reputational metrics,  publication tools,  user profiling and organizational management we have come to associate with social network platforms. 

Like many contemporary technical platforms, Github has  describes and performs its own growth. It presents itself through large numbers such as `48 million projects`, and these numbers in their sometimes daily changes and updates attest to an investment in future-revenue asset construction. These platform numbers are often accompanied by images that concretise the social identity and geographic location of developers. In June 2014, the Github homepage showed a photo of a woman working in an urban office-loft (presumably San Francisco, where Github  is based), with lights and professional camera focused on her work. It described '6.1 million people collaborating right now across 13.2 million repositories ... to build amazing things together' [@Github_2014]. In late November 2015, Github had a slightly more functional description, and the image seemed to be of Github founders in a press conference in China:

>GitHub is how people build software. With a community of more than 12 million people, developers can discover, use, and contribute to over 29 million projects using a powerful collaborative development workflow. [@Github_2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20151216055610/https://github.com/about)

The numbers change over time alongside the composition of the actors involved (women coding and working at Github, a sore point for the company; Chinese developers using Github, but also political activists, leading to a denial of service attack on Github, allegedly by the Chinese government [^3.1]). But the changing numbers, alongside the sometimes rather sublime scales of 'community' (a 'community' of 18 million people?) in several respects only highlight and even exacerbate the difficulty of grasping the composition of Github as an ensemble. 

[^3.1]: Neither image -- the woman at work in a loft-conversion office or the press conference in China -- is arbitrary, again suggesting that enumeration is always also configurative in the sense of materialising imaginaries of wholeness, difference, inclusion, etc.  Github was rocked in 2012 by allegations of sexism and mismanagement, particularly associated with one of the co-founders, who subsequently resigned and left Github [@Github_2014]. In early 2015, Github itself was subject to a massive Denial of Service attack, emanating from China. Reports alleged that the DoS attack targeted pro-democracy repositories on Github. Unlike its regulation of other social media platforms, China does not block Chinese citizens' use of Github because Github is seen as economically and commercially important for the software industry [@Marczak_2015].

Numbers such as 18 million 'people' and `48 million` 'projects' are part and parcel of platform capitalization. Github has attracted large investments of capital in the last few years (\$US100 million from the venture capital investment fund Andressen-Horowitz in 2012) on the basis of these numbers. They may be somewhat 'false numbers' as Martha Lampland suggests, designed to enable certain forms of rationalization [@Lampland_2010] or investment [@Plassnig_2016]. They have the feel of what Carolin Gerlitz and Celia Lury describe in their study of the social reputation website Klout as 'reactive numbers' meant to evoke further work, action and engagement [@Gerlitz_2014]. They may support claims of global importance. And they change: the series of numbers 29, 31, and now `48 million` announce and perhaps enact Github as an 'enumerated entity'  in time [@Verran_2012, 61]. The  platform numbers that feature on Github's webpages re-play in other settings (for instance, in the many articles appearing in newspapers, magazines and business press about the popularity and growth of Github; see [@Hardy_2012;@Meyer_2013; @Gage_2015; @Newcomer_2016; @Plassnig_2016]). 

Platform numbers resemble other numbers in their cardinality (the count of elements): population statistics for small nations, amounts of money spent on a new building, a research programme or a CEO's remuneration. But in platform capitalization they become visible and circulate in ways that diverge from other enumerations. Their salience and pluri-potency will be described further below, but play a particular role in relation to platforms and their capitalization.  The simultaneously enumerate the gathering or aggregation of things and people around the platforms, and in their changes, evoke its potential to grow and perhaps to accommodate new actors. 

## Aggregating events

At the end of 2016, the Github platform counted `18 million people` and `48 million projects`. The people are software developers or coders (although, as ever with online platforms, a 'person' may be automated software or a bot [@Niederer_2010]. The Github projects counted in `48 million` are `git` repositories, named collections of files mainly containing code, but also a great variety of operational documents (settings, manuals, installation instructions, etc.), stored in many versions and varieties [@Mackenzie_2016b]. Any enumeration of Github contends with not only the sheer number of people visiting and using the platform, but the sprawling diversity of ways in which they associate with each other through repositories using one or more of several hundred different programming or scripting languages. It is difficult to say which platform number matters more -- the head count or the repository count. On Github, they often appear in tandem: '2,641,337 people hosting over 4,442,708 repositories' announces the Github home page on 27 November 2012 [@Github_2012].

How is the number `48 million` actually produced? The count of repositories, or 'projects' as Github more recently terms them, is, however, an artefact of the way that the flow of code into and out of Github  is structured by the platform. In order to allow many versions to exist, and many people to work on the same code without introducing conflicting or incompatible changes, every repository or project on Github closely tracks the state of the files it contains. Versions of the same project may exist in parallel and/or in time. Control of the merging and branching of versions of code allows platforms to be  updated, reconfigured, integrated, expanded, deployed and localised. In practice, many different ways of working with code exist side by side on Github. A remarkable variety of workflows occur on Github, and these workflows, sometimes comprising hundreds of thousands of distinct actions carried out on group projects, attest to the highly relational and commutative reality of technical platforms. 

The relational intricacy associated with code version control is premised on uniquely naming or otherwise identifying every single event or action on Github, even those that appear to be quite elementary. Take the act of copying a repository, which is called 'forking' by Github or 'cloning' by developers.  Such acts are published by Github on its API or Application Programmer Interface.  The act of publishing events on a API, or a programmatically accessed internet address,  attests to the fact that Github is part of an ensemble that connects different platforms, devices, sites and practices together through code [@Bucher_2013].

An extract from a single ForkEvent presents some of the unique naming practice that renders platform numbers countable: 

```
{
    "actor": {
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7136540?",
        "gravatar_id": "",
        "id": "7136540",
        "login": "stas-g",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stas-g"
    },
    "created_at": "2016-12-07 00:09:21 UTC",
    "id": "4979965325",
    "org": null,
    "other": "{\"actor\":{\"display_login\":\"stas-g\"}}",
    "payload": " ...,
    "public": "true",
    "repo": {
        "id": "22321806",
        "name": "ntd/tccv",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ntd/tccv"
    },
    "type": "ForkEvent"
}
```


The `ForkEvent` on Github shown in the data extract documents the act of an `actor` calling themselves `stas-g` copying or forking   the repository named `tccv`, a software project coordinated by the 'actor' calling themself `ntd`.[^2.1]  The data has various status designations -- it is a `public` event, it has a 'payload' (not included in the extract) -- and contains various indexical references or `id`s (`repo_id`, `actor_id`, `gravatar_id`) that both connect the event to other groups of people, organisations, repositories and images (`gravatar_id`). The intricate  syntax of this data (many brackets, inverted commas, colons, commas) attests to specific technical elements in the Github ensemble -- database  architectures in particular -- that  coordinate and align actors, actions, and code in time. More generally, the formatting of all actions  as events with attached 'payloads' (the contents of which are not shown in the data extract) permits precise enumeration of human and non-human elements, and opens the possibility of their changing configuration on the platform.  New actors might be added; relations might appear between repositories; the location of entities might shift, and forms of association ('organizations') might subsume or grow out or around all of this.

[^2.1]: In what follows, I use monospace font like `Github` when referring to entities named in the Github data. The typography highlights entities subject  to enumeration by platform numbers.

## Differentiating the flux of events into asset geographies

Formatting action in named events not only provides momentary apprehensions of the platform numbers. It creates space for what Leyshon and Thrift term 'asset geographies' [@Leyshon_2007,109].  As well as  affording lump sum totals such as `48 million` repositories, the flow of action formatted as named events yields a quite fine-grained sequence of numbers relating to different actors and things. The platform formatting of fluxes of action is both crucial to the  operation of the platform and to its capitalization as a future-oriented asset geography.  


```{r event-counts,  echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
library(knitr)
df = read.csv('data/event_counts.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
kable(df[df$events>0, c(1,2)], row.names=FALSE, caption='Github event counts 2012-2015')

```


Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) shows a more differentiated view of events on Github.[^13] Github itself  publicly presents all the events on the platform in various ways: through the platform-defining Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs; [@Github_2016]), through online archives such as [GithubArchive](http://www.githubarchive.org) or [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/)  [@GHTorrent_2017]  and through cloud-based data analytics platforms such as GoogleBigQuery [@GoogleInc_2016a]. These data-streams embody the changes, aggregations, and commutations occurring as technical platforms  take shape, concretise, localize or indeed disintegrate.  With around one million events each day (in December 2016), making sense of these processes might seem difficult. The 300 million or so events summarised in Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) range across a variety of different code repository practices ('push', 'create,' 'watch,' 'pullrequest',  'fork') that I will not explore in depth here. 

[^13]: The table results from the query `select type, count(type) as events from [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by type order by events descending`  run on the GithubArchive public dataset hosted on the cloud computing platform,  GoogleBigQuery.  An archive purporting to contain all of the Github data appeared in mid-2012. Ilya Grigorik, a 'Web Performance Engineer' at Google, launched a Github repository `igrigorik/githubarchive` linked to a website `GithubArchive.org` dedicated to amalgamating all the Github API public event data -- the so-called 'timeline' --  in one place [@Grigorik_2012].  Grigorik, or `igrigorik`not only published all the data in a cloud-based data store but transformed that data, whose formatting we have glimpsed above, into the flat tabular forms familiar in much statistical work, [@Campbell-Kelly_2003] and made it available through Google's newly launched cloud computing service, GoogleBigQuery.The GoogleBigQuery copy of the Github public timeline data is updated hourly. In late 2015, the main GithubArchive timeline dataset on GoogleBigQuery was frozen. Data after that date flows into new datasets named by the month. e.g. [https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107) points to the data for July 2011. This partitioning of the data on a 'big data' platform such as GoogleBigQuery attests to the voluminous flows of events through Github. For the purposes of my argument, and to simplify code slightly, I only make use of the main Github timeline dataset covering 2012-2015.

Github, like many contemporary  technical platforms, tracks and measures everything that happens on its platform. Metrics for its own operation are part of the ongoing re-invention of the ensemble. (See for instance, the [Github Engineering blog](http://githubengineering.com/) for many examples of this metric aspect of the ensemble). Knowing what is happening at various points in the distributed operation of Github is a key practical concern, just as it is in financial markets [@Knorr-Cetina_2002] or in control rooms more generally.  While some operational metrics -- response times of servers in the data centres, number of read/write operations/minute, etc. -- are constantly monitored and sometimes acted upon by engineers, the variety, heterogeneity, significance and possible economic value of what flows through the platform in the form of actions and practices of coding is much harder to gauge for Github. 

Uncertainty about or obscurity in what accumulated on the platforms does not thwart or damage platform capitalization. It can become a provocative or potentialising uncertainty in its own right if techniques or forms of realisation can be applied to it.  During 2012-2014 Github organised three 'Data Challenges' [@Github_2013] focused on the data that Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) draws on. The challenges (or competitions) invited entrants to use the GithubArchive or GoogleBigQuery data to make sense of what was happening on Github by producing visualizations, websites or interactive systems. Given the technical hurdles of working with large amounts of Github data, most entrants to the competitions were themselves developers or data scientists using Github. In this sense, the Data Challenges staged a recursive Github public [@Kelty_2005] concerned with making sense of platform numbers or engaged in  practical re-countings of the data. 

```{r osrc, fig.cap='The Open Source Report Card', echo=FALSE}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/osrc.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

Entrants to the Data Challenges  elaborated the platform numbers  in various experiential, geographic and infrastructural registers.  For instance,  the 'OpenSource Report Card' (http://osrc.dfm.io/)  or `dfm/osrc` by Dan Foreman-Mackay [@Foreman-Mackay_2014], is a prize-winning use of the timeline event data (see Figure \@ref(fig:osrc)). It ingests all the data from the Githubarchive, counting what developers do, when they do it, and with what programming languages. With this data stored, it then builds a predictive model to both profile a given Github user and predict similarities between that user and others. The `osrc` filters and arranges  the stream of events in the Github timeline in order to find similarities between people. An admonition from Foreman-Mackay  – 'Dear recruiters: While you read this, make sure that you remember that GitHub is not your C.V. and that these stats only provide a biased and one-sided view. This is just a toy. Don't take it too seriously! ' – suggests that even explicitly playful applications of the data quickly encounter processes of capitalization. For coders, programmers and software developers, the profile of their activity on Github repositories can be part of getting work.

In response to the Github Data Challenge in 2012, contestants looked for feelings or 'sentiments' in the event data.  Feelings associated with coding were mined by counting emotional words present in comments accompanying the Github events (http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/). The presence of words in these message can be cross-linked with programming languages in order to profile how different programming languages elicit different emotional reactions. Certain languages attract exasperation and others pleasure (see [@Coleman_2012] for a broader account of these feelings). The enumeration of affects animates the platform numbers with an underpinning affectivity associated with coding in both its vicissitudes and its unevenly shared dividends of participation in and control of technical platforms [@Chun_2011].

The platform numbers associated with Github also begin to acquire a geography through the Data Challenges.  Many entrants mapped coders and repositories by geographic location. The  mapping of Github contributions by location performed by David Fischer is typical in that it too counts events, but  emphasises the geography of the 'top' repositories, coders and their programming languages [@Fischer_2013a]. 

```{r octoboard, fig.cap='Octoboard: Github activity dashboard', echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics('figure/octoboard.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

Echoing the metrics and gauges that Github constructs to monitor and regulate its own operations, other entrants to the Data Challenges made live dashboards for Github. `Octoboard` (http://octoboard.com/) animates changes on Github using the timeline data [@Roussell_2015] (see Figure \@ref(fig:octoboard)). `Octoboard` elaborates and differentiates  the platform numbers in a range of enumerations that point to the liveliness of events on Github. It presents a summary of daily activity in major categories on Github – how many new repositories, how many issues, how repositories have been 'open sourced' today. It offers almost real-time analytics on emotions. Like many other dashboards associated with social media platforms, `octoboard` suggests that the constant change in associations between people and things  can no longer be known through leisurely rhythms of analysis, but be treated as  a problem  real-time awareness. Significant shifts, trends, hotspots of activity, improbably important marginal developments or breakdowns need to be brought into immediate view through  'stream analytics.' That is, not also does the data stream, but the analysis is meant to stream as well in order to be timely, lively and responsive to change.[^14]

The Data Challenges also simply highlight the publication  of the flow of platform events.  As the event data-stream is taken up in various quarters,   its public availability and transformation into maps, reports, dashboards, network visualizations and sentiment analyses  augments or supports the platform numbers that Github counts on. The figurations of labour, geography, affect, and logistics  enliven, animate, reactivate, localise and qualify  platform numbers such as 48 million.  They potentialise the numbers in terms of expansiveness, liveness  and further accumulation by summing them up in different ways (temporalities, networks of connections, geographies of work and affect) that might yield further ways of constructing assets with revenue streams.

[^14]: Looking slightly more widely,  the Github timeline data has quickly become a favourite training tool for data mining textbooks books that configure and convey the calculative agencies characteristic of platform numbers. In  *Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More,* Matthew Russell makes use of the Github timeline to demonstrate ways of uses social network analysis to highlight the important nodes and links between repositories and users [@Russell_2013]. Again, the propensity to apply network analysis approaches is widespread and endemic to the data itself, given the way that the event format is already implicitly framed by a network or 'social media' understanding. For academic researchers in computer science and certain parts of organisation studies, Github has been a boon because they study technologically and economically important practices software development in the wild much more easily.  Academic researchers in fields such as software engineering do social network analysis in order to gauge productivity, reuse, efficiency and other engineering and management concern [@Thung_2013]. Like the many Github-hosted projects discussed above, they analyse sentiment [@Guzman_2014], collaboration and productivity [@Dabbish_2012], and geography [@Takhteyev_2010].

## From platform number to configurative enumeration

I have been arguing that platform capitalization pivots on enumerations of a future-oriented asset geographies. These enumerations of people and things construct an uncertain magnitude whose capitalizing potential derives from the multiple ways in which what is enumerated might be re-counted or re-grouped in asset forms. These enumerations are synthetic, platform-specific counts. They commonly drawn on reputational measures such as 'likes,' 'watchers', and in the case of Github, the act of forking or copying code.  It is not, however, the case that platform capitalization necessarily produces stable forms of organisation or circulation.    Like Karl Marx's decomposition of the commodity form into shifting ratios  of forms of capital (fixed, relative and absolute surplus value, etc. [@Marx_1986], we might critically decompose platform numbers in the interests as (a) seeing how the numbers capture or fail to capture the forms of life they purport to enumerate and stabilise as assets; and (b) gauging whether platformization, or the process of rendering social life through platforms overflows the parameters of the associated asset geographies. The diversity seen in the Github Data Challenges also suggest the possibility of viewing platform numbers from a different angle: as an incitement to explore differences and changes in what happens on Github (and similar technical platforms).

I am suggesting, then, that platforms numbers have configurative, compositional and figural modalities that do not simply act performatively (as most current understandings of capitalization and related cultural-economic processes presume; see [@Mohamed_2011; @Boll_2014; @Cardwell_2015; @Paudyn_2015;  @Jerne_2016; @Yarrow_2016]), but  derive from pre-capitalizing processes specific to the platform in question.[^211.1] More than performative, platform numbers are configurative. 

The configurative modality of platform numbers appears already in a seemingly trivially abundant yet elementary entity in code and on  Github more generally, the *name.* As Ludwig Wittengstein suggests, 'only in the nexus of a proposition does a name have a meaning' [@Wittgenstein_2003, 3.3].  'Naming' lies at the heart of the massive systems of addressability associated with software (see [@Thrift_2002]).  The sample data shown in Data Extract 1 suggests that events in the  Github timeline data and on the platform more generally can be understood as nexus of named entities.  The event data format is a nexus of names referring to people, organisations, repositories, platforms, code libraries or packages, as well as a very wide range of devices  and places. This seemingly trivial feature of code-driven technical platforms -- the reliance on names as a form of address amidst huge numbers of technical elements -- powerfully informs both the platform number `48 million`, and the configurative dynamism associated with it.  Github's platform numbers count people and  repositories precisely because entities (people, devices, locations, etc.) have been named. 

[^211.1]: For the beginnings of discussion moving beyond the performative, see [@Pellandini-Simanyi_2016;@Cooper_2016]. In a post-performative vein, we might consider numbers such as prices, scores, rankings, and indexes that sociological and anthropological accounts have explored precisely in terms of such overflow modalities (see [@Verran_2012; @Guyer_2014] for instance). Numbers, or 'figures' in the numerical sense of the term,  *configure* through enumeration, through seriation and through evocations of scale, limit and change. 

```{r power-time, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The power of events over time'}

include_graphics('figure/figure3_events.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

What  would happen if we approach the platform number `48 million`   with an eye on the diverse temporal, associative and above all configurative composition of named entities in the timeline event data (as published on GoogleBigQuery)?[^4.1] The beginning of such an encounter appears in Figure \@ref(fig:power-time). This not-so simple plot of the number of events associated with different Github repositories suggests, first of all,  that the vast majority of repositories on Github are highly ephemeral. On the top left hand side of the figure, millions of repositories receive less than five events. On the right hand side, less than 50 repositories receive more than a thousand events.

[^4.1]: Examining just the names of repositories in the Github API  data, counting how often and when they appear in events begins to show how associations are configured. A host of methodological questions cluster around the question of counting names. For the purposes of this discussion, I leave aside the many sidetracks, dead-ends and plain failures associated with working on a several hundred gigabyte dataset. While we rely  on repository names as the principal identifier in this paper, it would also be possible to count and re-count other identifiers or indexes, such as event IDs, timestamp, user names, etc. 

The simple act of counting the number of events received by each repository re-scales the platform number of repositories in one key respect.  Ephemeral repositories (if that is not too great a contradiction in terms) vastly outnumber repositories that endure. Ephemera constitute the main body of the `48 million` repositories (that is, repositories comprising one event constitute more than 50% of the 48 million). Millions of repositories flash into existence on the timeline for a brief period before falling back into uneventful obscurity. (A similar pattern appears in the other platform number: while some 'people'  emit many thousands of events, others only trigger a few.[^5.1]) Already, then, this re-configuration splits the platform number of repositories on Github: we might differentiate eventful and uneventful repositories.  Given that repositories are a primary asset form on Github,  it might seem strange that the vast bulk of them are so uneventful. Rather than seeing this ephemerality as waste, noise or something to be discarded, we might regard some of these uneventful repositories as pointing to differential processes at work in platform numbers. 

[^5.1]: This re-counting of platform numbers only includes the public repositories and actors on Github. An unknown but substantial number of repositories are private. In the light of Github's financial valuation at \$US 2 billion in 2015, this number may be quite large [@Gage_2015].

A second configurative differentiation appears in Figure \@ref(fig:power-time). Most repositories come into existence through  an act of copying --'forking'-- another repository. In Figure \@ref(fig:power-time), two separate sets of points distinguish repositories that are forks from those are not.  People 'fork' other repositories frequently and we can this glimpse this forking in the event counts.  Each time a repository is forked, an `ForkEvent` appears in the timeline event data. Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) shows 10 million ForkEvents, suggesting that around one third of the total 29 million repositories (in existence at the end of 2015) began life as copies.  Surprisingly, the fork repositories attract more events than those that are not forked. The lower right hand end of Figure \@ref(fig:power-time) suggests that  repositoriesi created through forking or copying have some of the highest event counts. 



```{r bootstrap-forks, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='`bootstrap` repository forks'}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/figure4_bootstrap_stackplot_no_bootstrap_2016-03-24-11-28.svg', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

```{r android-forks, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='`android` repository forks'}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/figure5_android_stackplot_2016-03-24-11-12.svg', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

A final example of the convoluted growth forms occurring on platforms can been seen in how repositories combine with each other. If copying powerfully drives the growth of platform numbers, but repositories also derive from commutations of existing repositories. Both Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap-forks) and \@ref(fig:android-forks) count  the number of repositories that commute or recombine existing repositories. Rather than counting overall or fork events, these plots how some repositories (`bootstrap`, `android`, etc.) attract a comet's tail of variations that augment and mutate its operations. Important repositories act as high visibility technical landmarks around which ensembles concretise in widely varying configurations. 

Two processes interweave here.  People or other actors fork repositories such as `bootstrap` (a very widely used code library developed by Twitter that supplies visual elements for web-based user interfaces) or `android` (the operating system developed by Google and used on most smart phones, tablets and mobile computing devices).[^22]  Each day, new combinations of existing repositories appear as new repositories on the platform  -- e.g. `bootstrap-android`, `android-tensorflow`. The striations  seen in the figures count forks made of repositories whose name incorporates the base repository. These repositories associate with the `bootstrap` or `android` repository, but diverge from it in different directions. A repository may, for instance, relate to `bootstrap` yet combine it with some other platform,  device or infrastructure such as `android` or `jQuery`.  The repositories that populate the striations in the diagram   generate large numbers of events on Github, and hence strongly animate platform numbers. But recombining repositories populating these figures will never have prominence comparable to the base repositories they relate to. These striations mark processes -- an incessant commutation of technical elements in the ensembles -- that can barely appear as such. 

[^22]: The ForkEvents are not included in the Figures \@ref(fig:android-forks) and \@ref(fig:bootstrap-forks)

## The generalization of configuration

```{r repo-names, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
  prettyNum(x, big.mark=" ")
  })
library(bigrquery)
if (file.exists('data/repository_names_count_events_top1000.csv')) {
    df = read.csv('data/repository_names_count_events_top1000.csv')
} else {   
    query = 'SELECT lower(repository_name) as repository_name, count(lower(repository_name)) as count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by repository_name order by count desc LIMIT 1000'
    # need to actually run this query if file does not exist
}

q = 'dot|test|hello|build|setting|demo|config|git|learn|issue|doc|homebrew'
q1_sum = sum(df$count[grep(x=df$repo_names_clean, q)])
q2 = 'cv|resume'
q2_sum = sum(df$count[grep(x=df$repo_names_clean, q2)])
total_events = sum(df['count'])
config_proportion = (q1_sum+q2_sum)/total_events
top_1000_proportion= round(total_events)/290000000 * 100
timeline_total_events = 290000000
```

Platform numbers, and their associated future-asset geographies cover over these ephemeral, associative and combinatory  processes. The abundance of short-lived, copied or re-combined repositories is not inimical to growth and future revenue streams, but it suggests that any such growth is secondary to the underlying dynamism of this  background activity, activity that lies very close to the practices and lives of people using the platform. Platformizing and platform capitalization depends on the fabric woven through ephemeral, associative and combinatory processes.   In enumerating the repository count, one final very small fragment of the `48 million`, effectively 1000 repositories or 0.002 \% of the total number of repositories, looms large. The top 1000 repositories attract around `r round(total_events/timeline_total_events * 100)`\% of all events in the timeline period.[^24] Two different tendencies stand out in this subset of the 48 million. The small number of very high-event rate repositories is led by a repository called `eclipse.platform.common`. The repository `eclipse.platform.common` accounts for almost 2 million events on Github to date. A single repository receiving two million events (or almost 1\% of the total event count for the platform)  suggests an important site for  coding cultures.  The fact that `eclipse` is itself part of the Eclipse Foundation, 'an amazing open source community of Tools, Projects and Collaborative Working Groups' [@EclipseFoundation_2016] with almost a thousand of its own projects all focused on developing tools, systems, and environments for software development,  helps explain the large number of events. The flow of events around `eclipse` attests to the ongoing genesis of technical tools essential to platformization. The coding, maintenance and even deployment of platforms takes place in software development environments such as `eclipse` and even the decades old `vim` code editor. Their configuration, maintenance, and openness to change are constant objects of attention.

[^24]: The GoogleBigQuery query de-capitalises the repository names for the purposes of enumeration (e.g. a repository called `DotFile` will be counted along with `dotfile`). Given the flattening of the names to lower case produced by this query, we cannot readily see how individual events are distributed. But these highly frequented repositories, which only comprise a tiny percentage of the 29 million on  Github, absorb many events. The query is `SELECT lower(repository_name) as repository_name, count(lower(repository_name)) as count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by repository_name order by count desc LIMIT 1000`

The high number of events  received by  `eclipse.platform.common` suggests, perhaps more importantly for our purposes, that the dynamism of platforms, their capacity to grow,  to change or stabilise, to hybridize or even infrastructuralize [@Plantin_2016] is a highly distributed process.  For instance, the `eclipse` repositories are not actively developed on  Github. The code found in that repository  is a  mirror  or frequently updated copy of the hundreds of `git` repositories found at [git.eclipse.org](https://git.eclipse.org). The development and much of the associative fabric of `eclipse` does not reside on  Github, but is copied there.[^10.1] In other words, the many events flowing into the `eclipse.platform.com` repository on Github are copies of work done elsewhere. For many other significant repositories (`linux`, `android`, `mozilla`, `apache`), high event counts attest here to Github's function as a mirror for technical action taking place elsewhere.  Many events animating the platform numbers of repositories and 'people' imitate things happening elsewhere.

[^10.1]: The presence of `eclipse` on Github suggests another important analytical problem to consider when enumerating: how do know for a given setting or place that what we count belongs there? Sometime repositories on Github mention they are 'mirrors' of something else. Other times they may not.

A final tendency in high event-count repositories is seemingly trivial yet vital to the ongoing genesis of technical platforms as configured operational realities.   The list of names of high-event count repositories cluster around a few highly repeated items: `test`, `hello`, `config`, `doc`, `build`, `setting` or `demo` recur frequently as repository names. The repetition of such names -- for instance, the many repositories that contain the term `dot` as in `dotfile` or `vimdot` -- exemplifies the copying and commutation discussed above, but it points to something specific to configuration as the composition of a technical platform. These repositories store  configurations and record work done to sustain configuration of technical elements and machines in particular places. In the platform number `48 million`, the proportion of events absorbed by  repositories explicitly concerned with configuration is substantial. Of the events received by the top 1000 repositories, `r round(config_proportion*100)`% belong to configuratively-named  repositories. These repositories explicitly focus on setting up and maintaining the small but crucial technical details of configuration that connect code libraries, editors, build tools,  databases, network connections, online access and authorisations needed by developers in order to position themselves within the operational ensemble of technical platforms.[^11.1]

[^11.1]:  For instance,  a `dotfile` repository will typically contain the settings for a software developer's terminal windows, code editor, and 'shell' or command line interface (see the heavily forked [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository for typical contents [@Bynens_2016]). The name `dotfile` refers to the fact that some operating systems hide from normal view file names beginning with the character `.` and configuration information is often, by convention, stored in such hidden files `dotfile`. The fact that many users will never see such `dotfiles` only highlights their relevance for developers organizing, interpreting and aligning machines, objects, devices and sub-ensembles with each other. We could look further for implicit configurative work in the timeline events. A query on the timeline dataset yields around ten million push events containing either a comment or message relating to 'config,' 'test' or 'build.' Similarly, a query for repositories that use no programming language results in around eleven million repositories. While null-code repositories vary greatly in their contents, many of them act as stores for configuration-related documentation, settings and data files.

## Conclusion

Platform capitalization can be understood as a organized asset structuring focused on networking forms of everyday life as future revenue streams. The case of Github  presents typical features of platform capitalization. It solicits sticky reputational behaviours associated with the habitus of coding and programming. It configures coding as a 'social' practice, replete with organisational and collaborative platform affordances. While code itself is the tangible asset here, code is indissolubly mixed with coding, in all its practical varieties and ntangible dimensions. Processes of collaboration, and programmers' identification with bodies of code are structured as assets alongside the code itself.

Platform capitalization enacts high-level summaries or totals -- platform numbers --  that anchor capitalization and connect it to other capitalization devices such as business models. The highly circulated user-counts and, in the case of Github, project counts enumerate an aggregate, imbue it with quantitative importance linked to platform scale and complexity, and promise to generate further accumulations of work and value. As we have seen, these platform numbers attract further enactments in the form of data archives (GithubArchive), financial investment and diverse data-enabled sense-making.

Even as platform numbers enact platformization, they offer little insight into the associative, commutative, imitative and configured dynamism that animates technical platforms. They evoke dynamism, a form of change vital to capitalization in its promissory modality,  but they cannot subsume or fully digest it. In key respects, Github might be a singular case of platform capitalization because it makes this indigestibility more obvious. It is platform where platforms are assembled, and where the ongoing shaping of platforms in their programmability is practically accomplished. Because it is a platformizing platform, a place where the coding masses technically and socially negotiation platform configurations, Github presents the possibility of observing some of the internal dynamics of platformization. Github presents, almost despite itself, and even as it seeks to centre forms of coding life on the platform, much evidence of  margins of indeterminacy and instability in practices of association, copying, imitations and localized configuration.

Compared to Facebook and many other platforms,  Github is relatively little known,  despite its importance as a site of ongoing platform configuration,  invention, maintenance and assembly.  This relative obscurity is perhaps, however, actually  typical of platform capitalization more generally if, as I have been suggesting, all platforms have a constitutive, configurative opacity rooted in their multiple, ensemble reality. 

In their recent work, Fabian Muniesa and co-authors advocate engagement with capitalization: 'Studying capitalization is also redefining it, engaging with it, against it, alongside it' [@Muniesa_2017, 127].  In this paper, I have approached platform numbers as they derive from naming practices native to code. This approach is platform-specific and pays close attention to 'contingent configuration' [@Langley_2016, 15]. Configurative enumeration views  platform numbers in ways that pay more attention to the their heterogeneous ensemble realities.  Departing from platform numbers,  configurative enumeration seeks to render visible the  margin of indetermination central to contemporary technical platforms. Treating platform numbers as configurative enumerations might give us a more plural sense of platformizing processes. We have seen the platform number of repositories on Github as a temporally, socially, materially variable configuration. 


The configurative re-enumerations presented in the preceding discussion do not exhaust the proliferating  combinations of machines, infrastructures, and connections taking and platforms. The  successive re-countings -- almost half of the repositories are copies or forks; the vast majority of repositories only ever receive 1-2 events; a substantial proportion of code repositories have no code in them; oriented recombination of projects heavily contribute to the repository count; many repositories mirror work done elsewhere, configurative repositories hold things together -- are not exhaustive enumerations. They are limited in their grasp of what happens  to that aspect of the platform ensemble held together by names, counted in  their copies and variations. But such configurative re-counting points to imitative fluxes, to patterns of variation, to the organizational life of platforms as ensemble realities,  to the ongoing processes of concretisation that technical platforms undergo as part of their genesis, and to the configurative processes  that in many ways precede and sometimes de-stabilise the  capillary extraction of value in capitalization.
