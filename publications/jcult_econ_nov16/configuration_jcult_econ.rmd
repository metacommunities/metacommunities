# Abstract


Technical ensembles such as social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems constitute an increasingly large yet relative obscure zone of contemporary cultures. 
This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them.
Via a case study of a large technical ensemble -- the code repository Github.com -- that itself hosts the ongoing software development for many contemporary digital technical ensembles, it analyzes how such enumerations align themselves to the capitalization of the  technical ensemble.
As an alternative to this capitalization, the paper proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and synchronisation, and the constant discarding and repairing of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles comes into view.
An orientation and attunement to configuration, the paper suggests, provides an alternative critical affirmation of the realities of technical ensembles, without simply re-iterating their capitalization. 

# Introduction

The reality of technical ensembles is difficult to engage with sociologically. At macro-scale, large  technical ensembles are highly prominent forms of organisation of economic and cultural life. We need only thing of Facebook with 1.6 billion users as an example of a technical ensemble.  Its  effects on work, sociality, political  or cultural practices are widely discussed and debated.  At the micro-scale of individual experiences, such platforms largely disappear as ensembles, even as their interfaces and their terminals absorb large parts of people's lives in on-screen attention. Technical ensembles largely comprise an obscure central zone of practices, objects, processes and systems. Concepts of infrastructure, device, media and assemblage struggle for analytic purchase on this central zone of technical ensembles, a zone where combinations of sub-ensembles, machines, platforms, tools, processes of invention, practices of work, technical, geographical, social and energetic materialities entwine in manifold ways.  Importantly, large technical ensembles have temporalities of concretisation and abstraction, of oriented mutations and adaptation, that cannot be easily conceptualised in terms of tools, machine or infrastructures. They have a collective and social order that is not hierarchically organised, nor purely lateral flow. Today, their associative, imitative and often highly layered fabric owes much to the forms of software development or coding  woven through them. 

The difficulty of engaging with technical ensembles stems, if Gilbert Simondon is right, from the way in which the reality of technical objects has increasingly crystallised in collections of technical elements such as tools and machines [@Simondon_1989, 81]. In these collections, the reality of the ensemble can be expressed neither in the figure of the proprietor, the executive or chief operator (which in the case of Facebook would be  Mark Zuckerberg), nor in the figure of the myriad workers and users attached to the ensemble (who in the case of Facebook could well be any reader, whether they use Facebook or not [@Marshall_2016]). Neither property nor labour, the underpinnings of any critical political economy,  access the reality of the technical ensemble, according to Simondon, because they both tend to treat the ensemble as an individual technical object, not as an ensemble or  as a mutable configuration. 

# A capital number

Assuming that technical ensembles do have an unstable configuration, how would we engage with it sociologically? This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a single large number, currently standing at 48 million, associated with the existence of contemporary technical ensembles. The number 48 million concerns the number of code repositories on the social media platform Github. The number stands in or represents what happens on  Github: coding or software development. 'Github is now people build software' according to Github  [@Github_2015]. For present purposes, Github is not itself the focus. Rather the millions of coding projects and millions of developers assembled there are. Github itself is a technical ensemble, but the obscure central zone or reality of technical ensembles might be more productively pursued in the myriad projects there.      

Before turning to that single number, 48 million, it is important to recognise some key shifts in the way that technical ensembles aggregate, concretise and change over time. These shifts are can be identified in coding practices.  Coding practices have changed over the last decade or so in several profound ways. The organization of software development has shifted away from individual machine-centred software development (the kind epitomised by Microsoft Windows or IBM mainframe software during the latter part of last century [@Campbell-Kelly_2003; @Ensmenger_2010]) to a much more de-centralized architectures of varying scope threaded across into communication and network infrastructures. Second, the geography of coding work still centres on well-established urban centres such as San Francisco and London [@Mackenzie_2016], but by virtue of a much wider distribution of coding tools and skills, occurs in many other places as well. Third, added to this global geography of coding, an explosion of digital devices and infrastructures, ranging from proliferating mobile devices and sensors to mushrooming data centres,  have widened the reach and variety of coding. Code circulates and addresses many more elements of the equipmental totality [@Heidegger_TBA]  - cameras, doors, cars, books -  than it did at the turn of the 21st century. Fourth, the lines and borders separating the production, distribution, and operation of code in technical ensembles have thoroughly blurred. Code flows in much more diverse ways through infrastructures and devices. For instance, 'devops' (development-operations) deploys frequently revised code directly into the ongoing transformative-maintenance of information infrastructure through continuous deployments, often directly from code repositories on sites such as Github [@Mackenzie_2016b].  Finally, across all of these changes, coding has become a much more *public* economic and cultural activity (see [@Kelty_2008]), and the *publicness of code* has become a major concern for business, art,  government and science, albeit for different reasons (for instance, in scientific work, open data has been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of techniques, resources and tools for publishing code written for scientific purposes; for instance, in the many attempts to train school students and others to code as a putative 'basic life skill').
