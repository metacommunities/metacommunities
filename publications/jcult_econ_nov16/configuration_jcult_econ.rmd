## Abstract

Technical ensembles such as social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems are central  to contemporary cultural processes. 
This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them.
Via a case study of a large technical ensemble -- the code repository [Github.com](https://github.com) -- that itself hosts the ongoing software development for many contemporary digital technical ensembles, it analyzes how such enumerations align themselves to the capitalization of the  technical ensemble.
As an alternative to this capitalization (in the form of capital numbers), the paper proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and the constant relating, tuning, repairing and adjusting of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles comes into view.
An orientation and attunement to configuration, the paper suggests, provides an alternative critical affirmation of inventive realities of technical ensembles, which sometimes diverge from or precede their capitalization. 

## Introduction

The reality of technical ensembles is difficult to engage with sociologically. At macro-scale, large  technical ensembles are highly prominent forms of organisation of economic and cultural life. We need only think of Facebook with 1.6 billion users as an example of a technical ensemble.  Its  effects on work, sociality, political  or cultural life are widely discussed and debated.  At the micro-scale of individual experiences, such platforms largely disappear as ensembles, even as their interfaces and their terminals absorb parts of people's lives in on-screen attention. The central zones of technical ensembles, however, remain largely obscure. Concepts of infrastructure, device, media and assemblage, and more recently, algorithm,  struggle for analytic purchase on the central zone of technical ensembles, a zone where combinations of sub-ensembles, machines, platforms, tools, processes of invention, practices of work, technical, geographical, social and energetic materialities entwine in manifold ways.  Importantly, large technical ensembles have temporalities of concretisation and abstraction, of oriented mutations and adaptation, that cannot be easily conceptualised in terms of tools, machine or infrastructures. The ensembles adhere to collective and social order that is not hierarchically organised, nor purely lateral flow. Today, their associative, imitative and often highly layered fabric owes much to the forms of software development or coding  woven through them. 

The difficulty of engaging with technical ensembles stems, if Gilbert Simondon is right, from the way in which the reality of recent technical objects has increasingly crystallised in collections of technical elements such as tools and machines as technical ensembles [@Simondon_1989, 81]. In these collections, the reality of the ensemble can be expressed neither in the figure of the proprietor, the executive or chief operator (which in the case of Facebook would be  Mark Zuckerberg), nor in the figure of the myriad workers and users attached to the ensemble (who in the case of Facebook could well be any reader, whether they use Facebook or not [@Marshall_2016]). Neither property nor labour  access the configured and concrete operational reality of the technical ensemble, according to Simondon, because they both tend to treat the ensemble as an individual technical object, not as an ensemble or  as a mutable configuration, and mold perceptions of the technical ensemble according to either the utility or exchange value. 

## A technical meta-ensemble

Assuming that technical ensembles do have a configured operational reality, how would we engage with it sociologically? This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a single large number, currently standing at 48 million, associated with the collective existence of contemporary technical ensembles. The number '48 million' concerns the number of code repositories on the social media platform Github. The number stands in or represents what happens on  Github: coding or software development. 'Github is how people build software' according to Github  [@Github_2015]. While it is itself a technical ensemble, for present purposes, Github itself is not the primary focus. Given the millions of coding projects and millions of developers assembling it, Github  is a place where the obscure central zone or reality of technical ensembles might be more productively analyzed.

Github  instances key shifts in the way that technical ensembles aggregate, concretise and change over time. These shifts are heavily linked to coding practices.  Coding practices have changed over the last decade or so in several profound ways. The organization of software development has shifted away from individual machine-centred software development (the kind epitomised by Microsoft Windows or IBM mainframe software during the latter part of last century [@Campbell-Kelly_2003; @Ensmenger_2010]) to a much more de-centralized architectures of varying scope threaded across into communication and network infrastructures. Second, added to this global geography of coding, an explosion of digital devices and infrastructures, ranging from proliferating mobile devices and sensors to mushrooming data centres,  have widened the reach and variety of coding. Code circulates and addresses many more elements of the equipmental totality [@Heidegger_TBA]  - cameras, doors, cars, books -  than it did at the turn of the 21st century. Third, the lines and borders separating the production, distribution, and operation of code in technical ensembles have thoroughly blurred. Code flows in much more diverse ways through infrastructures and devices. For instance, 'devops' (development-operations) deploys frequently revised code directly into the ongoing transformative-maintenance of information infrastructure through continuous deployments, often directly from code repositories on sites such as Github [@Mackenzie_2016b].  Fourth, although the geography of coding work still centres on well-established urban centres such as San Francisco and London [@Mackenzie_2016], but by virtue of a much wider distribution of coding tools and skills, occurs in many other places as well. Finally, across all of these changes, coding has become a much more *public* economic and cultural activity (see [@Kelty_2008]), and the *publicness of code* has become a major concern for business, art,  government and science, albeit for different reasons (for instance, in scientific work, open data has been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of techniques, resources and tools for publishing code written for scientific purposes; for instance, in the many attempts to train school students and others to code as a putative 'basic life skill'). These five tendencies in coding work, all of which traverse and structure Github itself, perhaps merit much closer attention. But I offer them here as a way of signalling some of the complexities involved in making sense of contemporary technical realities. Github, we might say, is a technical meta-ensemble because it intensifies all of these tendencies in coding and software development. 

## Capital numbers

The social media site Github, started in in 2007, epitomises and has indeed been central -- as the suffix 'hub' suggests -- to the changes in developing code and hence in the relational fabric of many technical ensembles. Like other social media platforms, it has grown tremendously in the last 7 years. This growth flows from a tremendous variety of processes that are difficult to summarise or classify partly because the actors, topics or domains of coding are so diverse and partly because much of what flows through Github is both technically and socially 'innovative' in the sense that Bruno Latour uses the term: '" innovative" means that we do not know the number of actors involved in advance' [@Latour_1996, 72]. Github's growth is not unique. Online code repositories have existed for several decades (most famously [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net)), although more recent arrivals such Github, [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), GoogleCode (which has closed and migrated to Github), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or Gitorious tend to invite and promote collaborative coding on a larger scale.

Like many contemporary assemblages, Github has difficulty in describing its own genesis. It presents itself through large numbers such as `48 million`, and these numbers in their sometimes daily changes and updates attest to an investment in open-ended enumerations. These numbers are often accompanied by images that localise the social identity and geographic location of developers. In June 2014, the Github homepage showed a photo of a woman working in an urban office-loft (presumably San Francisco, where Github  is based), with lights and professional camera focused on her work. It described '6.1 million people collaborating right now across 13.2 million repositories ... building amazing things together' [@Github_2014a]. In late November 2015, Github has a slightly more functional description, and the image seems to be of Github founders in a press conference in China:

>GitHub is how people build software. With a community of more than 12 million people, developers can discover, use, and contribute to over 29 million projects using a powerful collaborative development workflow. [@Github_2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20151216055610/https://github.com/about)

The numbers change over time alongside the composition of the actors involved (women coding and working at Github, a sore point for the company; Chinese developers using Github, but also political activists, leading to a denial of service attack on the Github, allegedly by the Chinese government [^3]). But the changing numbers, alongside the sometimes rather sublime scales of 'community' (a 'community' of 18 million people?) in several respects only highlight and even exacerbate the difficulty of engaging with Github as a typical contemporary technical ensemble. 

[^3]: Neither image -- the woman at work in a loft-conversion office or the press conference in China -- is arbitrary, again suggesting that enumeration is always also configurative in the sense of materialising imaginaries of wholeness, difference, inclusion, etc.  Github was rocked in 2012 by allegations of sexism and mismanagement, particularly associated with one of the co-founders, who subsequently resigned and left Github [@Github_2014]. In early 2015, Github itself was subject to a massive Denial of Service attack, emanating from China. Reports alleged that the DoS attack targeted pro-democracy repositories on Github. Unlike its regulation of other social media platforms, China does not block Chinese citizens' use of Github because Github is seen as economically and commercially important for the software industry [@Marczak_2015].

Numbers such as 18 million 'people' and 48 million 'projects' do display something of the mode of existence of technical ensembles. In important ways they are part and parcel of platform politics and financial technological economies [@Gillespie_2010]. Given the capital investments that Github has attracted in the last few years (\$US100 million from the venture capital investment fund Andressen-Horowitz in 2012), these numbers affect flows of capital.  They may be somewhat 'false numbers' as Martha Lampland suggests, designed to enable certain forms of rationalization [@Lampland_2010]. They have the feel of what Carolin Gerlitz and Celia Lury describe in their study of the social reputation website Klout as 'reactive numbers' meant to evoke further work, action and engagement [@Gerlitz_2014a]. They may support claims of global importance (such as Facebook's 1.6 billion users). And they change: the series of numbers 29, 31, and now 48 million announce and perhaps enact Github as an 'enumerated entity' [@Verran_2012, 61] in time.

While Github features capital numbers on its webpages, those numbers re-play in other settings (for instance, in the many articles appearing in newspapers, magazines and business press about the popularity and growth of Github; see [@Hardy_2012;@Meyer_2013; @Gage_2015]).  Capital numbers resemble others in their cardinality (the number of elements ): population statistics for small nations, amounts of money spent on a new building, a research programme or a CEO's remuneration. They become visible and circulate in ways that prevent them from being easily assimilated to biopolitical or financial numbers. Their salience and pluri-potency will be described further below, but already they warrant some kind of designation and differentiation. We might call them 'capital numbers.' Capital here has the triple sense of a centre ('hub'), the capital letter of a proper noun (the 'G' in Github), and an accumulated fund with potential to growth. A capital number enumerates an aggregate, localizing and associating with a proper name, and promises the potential to generate further accumulation.

## Assembling aggregate events

Take the number 48 million.  At the end of 2016,  the two main enumerations of Github  are 18 million 'people' and 48 million repositories. The people are software developers or coders (although, as ever with online platforms, a 'person' may be automated software or a bot [@TBA]. The Github projects counted here are `git` repositories,  collections of files mainly containing code, but also a great variety of operational documents (settings, manuals, installation instructions, etc.) stored in many versions and varieties. Any enumeration of Github contends with not only the sheer number of people visiting and using the platform, but the sheer diversity of ways in which they associate with each other through repositories using one or more of several hundred different programming or scripting languages. It is difficult to say which capital number matters more -- the head count or the repository count. On  Github, both normally appear in tandem: '2,641,337 people hosting over 4,442,708 repositories' announces the Github home page on 27 November 2012 [@Github_2012].

How does the number 48 million take shape? Github relies on elements of its own  technical ensemble to count the various actions of developers. The count of repositories is, however, an artefact of the way that the flow of code into and out of Github  is structured. In order to allow many versions to exist, and many people to work on the same code without introducing conflicting or incompatible changes, every repository or project on Github keeps snapshots of the state of the project. Versions of the same project may exist in parallel and/or in time. Control of the merging and branching of versions in projects lies at the centre of contemporary technical ensembles as they are updated, reconfigured, integrated, expanded, deployed and localised.  A remarkable proliferation of workflows appear on Github, and these workflows, sometimes comprising hundreds of thousands of distinct actions carried out on group projects, attest to the highly relational and commutative reality of technical ensembles. 

The relational intricacy arising from this control over versions affects almost every action or event on Github, even those that appear to be quite elementary. Take the act of copying a repository, which is called 'forking' by Github or 'cloning' by developers.  Such acts are published by Github on its API or Application Programmer Interface and this act of publishing itself attests to the fact that technical ensembles such as Github are themselves part of other ensembles that connect different platforms, devices, sites and practices together [@Bucher_2013]. An extract from a single recent ForkEvent is shown below.

```
{
    "actor": {
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7136540?",
        "gravatar_id": "",
        "id": "7136540",
        "login": "stas-g",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stas-g"
    },
    "created_at": "2016-12-07 00:09:21 UTC",
    "id": "4979965325",
    "org": null,
    "other": "{\"actor\":{\"display_login\":\"stas-g\"}}",
    "payload": " ...,
    "public": "true",
    "repo": {
        "id": "22321806",
        "name": "ntd/tccv",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ntd/tccv"
    },
    "type": "ForkEvent"
}
```


The relatively simple  `ForkEvent` on Github shown in the data extract above documents the act of an `actor` calling themselves `stas-g` copying or forking   the repository called `tccv`, a software project coordinated by the 'actor' calling themself `ntd`.[^2]  The data has various status designations -- it is a `public` event, it has a 'payload' (not included in the extract) -- and contains various indexical references or `id`s (`repo_id`, `actor_id`, `gravatar_id`) that both link the event to other groups of people, organisations, repositories and images (`gravatar_id`). The intricate  syntax of this data (many brackets, inverted commas, colons, commas) attests to specific technical elements in the Github ensemble -- database  architectures in particular -- that allow coordination and alignment between  actors, actions, and code in time. More generally, the formatting of all actions  as events attests to the potential for the precise configuration of actors around a given repository to change or mutate in some way. New actors might be added; relations might appear between repositories; the location of entities might shift, and forms of association ('organizations') might subsume or grow out or around all of this. Formatting such changes as events accommodates them all within Github itself as technical ensemble.

[^2]: In what follows, I use monospace font like `Github` when referring to entities named in the Github data. The typography highlights entities subject  to enumeration by capital numbers.

## Archiving the flux of events

For our purposes, the formatting of action and change in events  provides momentary apprehensions of the ongoing genesis of technical ensembles more generally. Rather than the lump sum of 48 million repositories, this data -- and there is much of it readily available since data flow is deeply important to  technical ensembles such as Github [^4]  -- provides a quite fine-grained series of numbers relating to different actors and things. The granularity comes at a cost. Instead of 48 million, we now have a much more detailed but configured series of numbers.

[^4]: An archive purporting to contain all of the Github data appeared in mid-2012. Ilya Grigorik, a 'Web Performance Engineer' at Google, launched a Github repository `igrigorik/githubarchive` linked to a website `GithubArchive.org` dedicated to amalgamating all the Github API public event data -- the so-called 'timeline' --  in one place [@Grigorik_2012].  Grigorik, or `igrigorik`not only published all the data in a cloud-based data store but transformed that data, whose formatting we have glimpsed above, into the flat tabular forms familiar in much statistical work, [@Campbell-Kelly_2003a] and made it available through Google's newly launched cloud computing service, GoogleBigQuery.


```{r event-counts,  echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
library(xtable)
library(knitr)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
df = read.csv('data/event_counts.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
kable(df[df$events>0, c(1,2)], row.names=FALSE, caption='Github event counts 2012-2015')

```

Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) shows something of the problem.[^13] Github itself  publicly presents all the events on the platform. From that, we might begin to grasp the kinds of change, aggregations, and commutations occurring as technical ensemble ensembles take shape, concretise, localize or indeed break down. But with around one million events each day (in December 2016), making sense of these processes might seem difficult. The 300 million or so events summarised in Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) suggest a variety of different practices ('push', 'create,' 'watch,' 'pullrequest',  'fork'), yet we can gain little sense of the distribution of the associated actions, what they refer to, or indeed to whom or what they might matter from such data. From the event counts, it seems, we gain nothing better than a slight feeling of awe in front of a post-industrial technical sublime. If we are interested in the obscure central zone of technical ensembles, how does this help?

[^13]: The table results from the simple query `select type, count(type) as events from [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by type order by events descending`  run on GoogleBigQuery. Like the data on GithubArchive, the GoogleBigQuery copy of the Github public timeline data was updated hourly. 
In late 2015, the main GithubArchive timeline dataset on GoogleBigQuery was frozen. Data after that date flows into new datasets named by the month. e.g. [https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107) points to the data for July 2011. This partitioning of the data on a 'big data' platform such as GoogleBigQuery attests to the voluminous flows of events through Github. For the purposes of my argument, and to simplify code slightly, I only make use of the main Github timeline dataset covering 2012-2015.

Github, like many contemporary  technical ensembles, tracks and measures everything that happens on its platform. Metrics for its own operation are part of the ongoing re-invention of the ensemble. (See for instance, the [Github Engineering blog](http://githubengineering.com/) for many examples of this metric aspect of the ensemble). Knowing what is happening at various points in the distributed operation of Github is a key concern, just as it is in financial markets [@Knorr-Cetina_2002] or in control rooms more generally.  While certain technical metrics -- response times of servers in the data centres, number of read/write operations/minute, etc. -- are constantly monitored and sometimes acted upon by engineers, the variety, heterogeneity, significance and possible economic value of what takes place in the ensemble is much harder to gauge, both for Github and perhaps for any sociological analysis of technical ensembles. 

During 2012-2014 Github organised 'data challenges' [@Github_2013] based on the GithubArchive event data. It invited entrants to these challenges to use the data to make sense of what was happening on Github. We could these data challenges from the perspective of capital numbers:  they occasion practical re-countings of the data that elaborate the capital numbers with greater mobility, value and media or inscriptive form. Given the technical hurdles of working with large amounts of Github data, most entrants to the competitions were themselves developers or data scientists. 

```{r osrc, fig.cap='The Open Source Report Card', echo=FALSE}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/osrc.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

For instance,  the 'OpenSource Report Card' (http://osrc.dfm.io/)  or `dfm/osrc` by Dan Foreman-Mackay [@Foreman-Mackay_2014], is a prize-winning use of the timeline data (see Figure \ref{fig:osrc}). It ingests all the data from the Githubarchive, counting what developers do, when they do it, and with what programming languages. With this data stored, it then builds a predictive model that allows it to both profile a given Github user, and to predict similarities between developers. Here the mass of events in the Github timeline are brought to bear on finding similarities between people. An admonition from Foreman-Mackay  – 'Dear recruiters: While you read this, make sure that you remember that GitHub is not your C.V. and that these stats only provide a biased and one-sided view. This is just a toy. Don't take it too seriously! ' – suggests that even playful application of the data attest to the proximity of capitalisation and labour value in what happens on Github. For coders, programmers and software developers, the profile of their activity on Github repositories can be part of getting work.

In response to the Github Data Challenge in 2012, people looked for feelings or 'sentiments' in the data.  Feelings associated with coding were mined by counting emotional words present in comments accompanying the Github events (http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/). The presence of words in these message can be cross-linked with programming languages in order to profile how different programming languages elicit different emotional reactions. This emphasises how software developers or coders feel in relation to different kinds of coding. Certain languages attract exasperation and others pleasure (see [@Coleman_2012] for a broader account of these feelings). The enumeration of affects animates the capital numbers with an underpinning affectivity associated with coding in both its vicissitudes and its unevenly shared dividends of participation in and control of technical ensembles [@Chun_2011].  

The capital numbers associated with Github also begin to acquire a geography through the GithubArchive data. Many entrants mapped coders and repositories by geographic location. The  mapping of Github contributions by location performed by David Fischer (http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/#languages/All) is typical in that it too counts events, but this time puts the emphasis on the geography of the 'top' repositories, coders and their programming languages [@Fischer_2013a]. 

```{r octoboard, fig.cap='Octoboard: Github activity dashboard', echo=FALSE}
    include_graphics('figure/octoboard.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

Echoing the metrics and gauges that Github constructs to monitor and regulate its own operations, other entrants to the data challenges made live dashboards for Github. `Octoboard` (http://octoboard.com/) animates changes on Github using the timeline data [@Roussell_2015] (see Figure \@ref(fig:octoboard)). `Octoboard` ornaments the capital numbers with a range of peripheral live enumerations that point to the liveliness of events on Github. It presents a summary of daily activity in major categories on Github – how many new repositories, how many issues, how repositories have been 'open sourced' today. It offers almost real-time analytics on emotions. Like many other dashboards associated with social media analytics, `octoboard` suggests that the constant change in associations and projects in software development can no longer be known through leisurely rhythms of analysis, but is increasingly framed as  a problem  realtime awareness. Significant shifts, trends, hotspots of activity, improbably important marginal developments or breakdowns need to be brought into immediate view through  'stream analytics.' That is, not also does the data stream, but the analysis is meant to stream as well in order to be timely, lively and responsive to change.


The data challenges attract many different treatments of the Github timeline data. They depend on the publication of the data flow of events as a  'big data' dataset on GoogleBigQuery. The dataset is taken up in various quarters, [^14] and its public availability  augments or supports the capital numbers that Github enumerates. The visualizations, maps, models and  dashboards of labour, geography, affect, and logistics  enliven, animate, reactivate, localise and qualify  capital numbers such as 48 million.  They potentialise the numbers in terms of expansiveness, liveness  and further accumulation by summing them up in different ways (realtime, networks of connections, geographies of work and affect), and by beginning to analyse forms of association or relation (social network analysis, machine learning classification and prediction). Small data publics take shape around the capital numbers.   

[^14]: Looking slightly more widely,  the Github timeline data has quickly become a favourite training tool for data mining textbooks books that configure and convey the calculative agencies characteristic of capital numbers. In  *Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More,* Matthew Russell makes use of the Github timeline to demonstrate ways of uses social network analysis to highlight the important nodes and links between repositories and users [@Russell_2013]. Again, the propensity to apply network analysis approaches is widespread and endemic to the data itself, given the way that the event format is already implicitly framed by a network or 'social media' understanding. For academic researchers in computer science and certain parts of organisation studies, Github has been a boon because they study technologically and economically important practices software development in the wild much more easily.  Academic researchers in fields such as software engineering do social network analysis in order to gauge productivity, reuse, efficiency and other engineering and management concern [@Thung_2013]. Like the many Github-hosted projects discussed above, they analyse sentiment [@Guzman_2014], collaboration and productivity [@Dabbish_2012], and geography [@Takhteyev_2010].

## From capital number to configurative enumeration

Calculative and technical  practices  associated with capital numbers, in all the diversity seen in the Github Data Challenges, suggest the need to think of capital numbers in a double sense as both summation of multiplicity and as an incitement to negotiate differences and change. This double sense of a capital number as a count and as a materially-specific figuring of differences can be understood in terms of Lucy Suchman's 'configuration' device:

> the device of _configuration_ has two broad uses. First, as an aid to delineating the composition and bounds of an object of analysis, in part through the acknowledgment that doing so so is integral not only to the study of technologies, but to their very existence as objects. And second, in drawing our analytic attention to the ways in which technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technological artefacts. Configuration in this sense is a device for studying technologies with particular attention to the imaginaries and materialities that they _join together_, an orientation that resonates as well with the term's common usages to refer to the conjoining of diverse elements in practices of systems design and engineering [@Suchman_2012, 48].

If numbers are configurations, they have bounds and a composition not unlike devices or technical ensembles. While the concept of a number as a device might seem a little stretched, we readily accept that  a great part of contemporary technical ensembles operates by virtue of deeply convoluted transformations of numbers. If numbers such as 48 million repositories are configurations, then their enumerative operations  will inevitably materialize  imaginaries of inclusion, value, or difference. Numbers, or 'figures' in the numerical sense of the term,  *configure* through enumeration, through seriation and through evocations of scale, limit and change. 

How could we treat the number  48 million repositories as a configurative enumeration?  This question is rather like the riddle 'what can you buy in a hardware store that costs £0.50 for one, £1.00 for two, and £1.50 for 144?' Solving the riddle means shifting perspective, relinquishing arithmetic (what can change price so radically as quantities increase?) and thinking about how numbers exist in the world, in this case, as house numbers. In what follows, in the re-counting of 48 millions as a configurative enumeration, I am less interested in exhaustive arithmetic manipulation of the capital number (for instance, of the kind that Marx performs as he re-calculates the value of labour in _Capital_ [@Marx_1986]) and more in the shift in perspective that allows us to understand the composition of numbers in technical ensembles.     

A configurative re-counting of capital numbers might begin with the seemingly trivially abundant yet absolutely basic entity in code and on  Github more generally, names. The sample event data shown above indicates many entities in the  Github timeline data and on the platform more generally are named. Names refer to people, organisations, repositories, platforms, code libraries or packages, as well as a very wide range of devices  and places. This trivial yet essential element of code-driven technical ensembles -- the reliance on names as a form of address amidst huge numbers of technical elements -- powerfully informs both the capital number 48 million, and the complicated configurations associated with it.  Github's capital numbers lump all people and all repositories together in a cumulative time series.   What  would happen if we re-count  the timeline data (as published on GoogleBigQuery) with an eye on the composition of named entities within that the capital number? [^4]

[^4]: Examining just the names of repositories in the timeline data, counting how often and when they appear in events begins to show how associations are configured on Github. A host of methodological questions cluster around the question of counting names. For the purposes of this discussion, I leave aside the many sidetracks, dead-ends and plain failures associated with working on a several hundred gigabyte dataset.

```{r power-time, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The power of events over time'}

include_graphics('figure/figure3_events.png', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

The beginning of such a recounting appears in Figure \@ref( fig:power-time ). This not-so simple plot of the number of events associated with Github repositories suggests that the vast majority of repositories on Github are highly ephemeral. On the top left hand side of the figure, millions of repositories receive less than five events during the 18 months. On the right hand side, less than 50 repositories receive more than a thousand events. They attract one or two events. A small number of repositories, counted on the lower right-hand side of the plot capture many thousand events.

Simply counting the number of events received by each repository re-scales the capital number of repositories in one key respect.  Ephemeral repositories (if that is not too great a contradiction in terms) vastly outnumber repositories that continue to attract attention and they constitute the main bulk of the 48 million repository. (Repositories comprising one event constitute more than 50% of the 48 million.)     Millions of repositories flash into existence on the timeline for a brief period before falling back into uneventful obscurity. (A similar pattern appears in the other capital number: while some 'people'  emit many thousands of events, others only trigger a few.[^5]) Already, then, the capital number of repositories on  Github takes on a different configuration: we might differentiate eventful and uneventful repositories.

[^5]: In  my re-counting of the capital numbers, the data relates to the public repositories and actors on Github. An unknown but substantial number of repositories are private. Given Github's financial valuation at $US 2 billion in 2015, this number may be quite large. [@Gage_2015]

Given that repositories are receptacles for all the work of software developers and coders, it seems strange that the vast bulk of them are so unventful. But rather than see this ephemerality as waste, noise or something to be discarded, we might regard some of these uneventful repositories as themselves technical elements in a broader technical ensemble. trace the working of associative processes through it. Tracking the patterns of imitation, rather than looking for the events that define repositories as important, allows something different to appear.

A second differentiation or configuration appears in Figure \@ref(fig:power-time). Many  repositories arise from the act of copying ('forking') another repository. In Figure \@ref(fig:power-time), two separate sets of points distinguish repositories that are forks from those are not.  People 'fork' other repositories frequently. Table \@ref(tab:event-counts) shows 10 million ForkEvents, suggesting that around one third of the total 29 million repositories (in existence at the end of 2015) are direct copies.  Surprisingly, the fork repositories attract more events than those that are not forked. The lower right hand end of Figure \@ref(fig:power-time) suggests that fork-created repositories have some of the highest event counts. 

## The commutative elements in technical ensembles

```{r bootstrap-forks, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='`bootstrap` repository forks'}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/figure4_bootstrap_stackplot_no_bootstrap_2016-03-24-11-28.svg', auto_pdf=TRUE)

```

```{r android-forks, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='`android` repository forks'}
    library(knitr)
    include_graphics('figure/figure5_android_stackplot_2016-03-24-11-12.svg', auto_pdf=TRUE)
```

To further expand our sense of how copying and related forms of imitation drive the growth of capital numbers, we could track how repositories appear as combinations of existing repositories. Both Figure \@ref(fig:bootstrap-forks) and \@ref(fig:android-forks) count imitations in the form of copying code, but in ways that go beyond the forking practices we have just been discussing. Rather than simply counting forks, these plots track how a base repository (`bootstrap` or `android`) is surrounded by multiplying configurations that augment and mutate its operations. Two different processes interweave here. Each day, people make forks of popular repositories such as `bootstrap` (a very widely used code library developed by Twitter that supplies visual elements for web-based user interfaces) or `android` (the operating system developed by Google and used on most smart phones, tablets and mobile computing devices). These events do not appear in the figures. The striations  seen in the figures count forks made of repositories whose name incorporates the base repository. These repositories associate with the `bootstrap` or `android` repository, but diverge from it in a multiplicity of ways. A repository may, for instance, relate to `bootstrap` yet combine it with a range of other platforms and devices such as `android` or `jQuery`.  The repositories that comprise the  striations in the diagram   generate large numbers of events on Github, and hence animate capital numbers. The repositories counted in these figures will never have prominence comparable to the base repositories they relate to. What is happening in these processes -- an incessant commutation of technical elements in the ensembles -- can barely appear as such. Important repositories act as high visibility technical landmarks around which ensembles concretise in widely varying configurations. 

## Extreme repositories and the generalization of configuration

```{r repo-names, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
  prettyNum(x, big.mark=" ")
  })
library(bigrquery)
if (file.exists('data/repository_names_count_events_top1000.csv')) {
    df = read.csv('data/repository_names_count_events_top1000.csv')
} else {   
    query = 'SELECT lower(repository_name) as repository_name, count(lower(repository_name)) as count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by repository_name order by count desc LIMIT 1000'
    # need to actually run this query if file does not exist
}

q = 'dot|test|hello|build|setting|demo|config|git|learn|issue|doc|homebrew'
q1_sum = sum(df$count[grep(x=df$repo_names_clean, q)])
q2 = 'cv|resume'
q2_sum = sum(df$count[grep(x=df$repo_names_clean, q2)])
total_events = sum(df$count)
config_proportion = (q1_sum+q2_sum)/total_events
top_1000_proportion= round(total_events)/290000000 * 100
timeline_total_events = 290000000
```

In enumerating the repository count, one final very small section of the 48 million, effectively 1000 repositories or 0.002% of the total number of repositories, loom large. The top 1000 repositories attract around `r round(total_events/timeline_total_events * 100)`% of all events in the timeline period.[^24] Two different tendencies stand out in this subset of the 48 million. The small number of extreme high-event rate repositories is led by a repository called `eclipse`. The repository `eclipse.platform.common` accounts for almost 2 million events in the Github timeline data. A single repository receiving two million events (or almost 1% of the total event count in the timeline data)  suggests a remarkably active site of technical work, and perhaps something highly significant in the geography of coding.  The fact that `eclipse` is itself part of the Eclipse Foundation,  'an amazing open source community of Tools, Projects and Collaborative Working Groups' [@EclipseFoundation_2016] with almost a thousand of its own projects all focused on developing tools, systems, and environments of software development,  might help explain the large number of events. The flow of events around `eclipse` attests to the relation of developers to the ongoing genesis of technical objects. Software development environments such as `eclipse` and even the decades old `vim` code editor are the locus of the coding work, and their configuration, maintenance, and openness to change are constant objects of attention.

[^24]: The GoogleBigQuery query de-capitalises the repository names for the purposes of aggregation (e.g. a repository called `DotFile` will be counted along with `dotfile`). Given the flattening of the names to lower case produced by this query, we cannot readily see how individual events are distributed. But these highly frequented repositories, which only comprise a tiny percentage of the 29 million on  Github, absorb many events. The query is `SELECT lower(repository_name) as repository_name, count(lower(repository_name)) as count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by repository_name order by count desc LIMIT 1000`


At the same time, the high-frequency of events  received by  `eclipse.platform.common` suggests that  Github itself functions as a technical element in other technical ensembles.  The `eclipse` repositories are not actively developed on  Github. They are mirrored  or frequently  copied from hundreds of `git` repositories found at [git.eclipse.org](https://git.eclipse.org). The development and much of the associative fabric of `eclipse` does not reside on  Github, but is copied there.[^10] The many events attracted by `eclipse.platform.com` are copies of associative acts occurring elsewhere. Like many other significant repositories (`linux`, `android`, `mozilla`, `apache`), high event counts attest here to Github's function as a repository for technical action taking place elsewhere. We might, therefore,  also re-count many events flowing into  capital numbers of repositories and 'people' in terms of what in them is a mirroring or reflection of things happening elsewhere.

[^10]: The presence of `eclipse` on Github suggests another important analytical problem to consider when enumerating: how do know for a given setting or place that what we count belongs there? Sometime repositories on Github mention they are 'mirrors' of something else. Other times they may not.

The second tendency of the high event count repositories is seemingly trivial yet vital to the ongoing genesis of technical ensembles.   The list of names of high-event count repositories includes many containing a set of terms centred on a few highly repeated items. On the one hand, the sharing of names -- for instance, the many repositories that contain the term `dot` as in `dotfile` or `vimdot` -- suggests the imitation or repetition that Tarde describes. On the other hand, terms like `test`, `hello`, `config`, `doc`, `build`, `setting` or `demo` also recur frequently in this set of repository names. Many repository names proliferate from these stems. All of these repositories  configurations and work done to sustain the configuration of devices in particular places.

The proportion of events absorbed by  repositories explicitly concerned with configuration is substantial. Of the events received by the top 1000 repositories, `r round(config_proportion*100)`% belong to configurative  repositories. These repositories explicitly focus on setting up and maintaining the small but crucial technical details of configuration that connect code libraries, editors, build tools,  databases, network connections, online access and authorisations needed by developers in order to position themselves within the central zone of the technical ensemble. For instance,  a `dotfile` repository will typically contain the settings for a software developer's terminal windows, code editor, and 'shell' or command line interface (see the heavily forked [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository for typical contents [@Bynens_2016]). The name `dotfile` refers to the fact that some operating systems hide from normal view file names beginning with the character `.` and configuration information is often, by convention, stored in such hidden files `dotfile`. The fact that many users will never see such `dotfiles` only highlights their relevance for developers organizing, interpreting and aligning machines, objects, devices and sub-ensembles with each other.[^11]

[^11]: We could look further for implicit configurative work in the timeline events. A query on the timeline dataset yields around ten million push events containing either a comment or message relating to 'config,' 'test' or 'build.' Similarly, a query for repositories that use no programming language results in around eleven million repositories. While null-code repositories vary greatly in their contents, many of them act as stores for configuration-related documentation, settings and data files.

## Conclusion

'It is through the intermediary of a margin of indetermination and not through automation that machines can be grouped in coherent ensembles'  writes Gilbert Simondon [@Simondon_1989, 12]. Simondon's account of technical objects offers to contemporary understandings of techno-economic cultures some ways of articulating the configurations, the margins of indetermination and the processes of invention that in many ways precede and sometimes de-stabilise the powerfully extractive capillary extraction of value in capitalisation. 

The contrast between capital and configurative numbers I have been describing in this paper has sought to render visible a margin of indetermination specific to contemporary code-based technical ensembles. Capital numbers -- the commonly repeated user-counts and in the case of Github, project counts --  enumerate an aggregate, imbue it with importance linked to infrastructural scale and complexity, and promise to generate further accumulation. As we have seen, the capital numbers attract further aggregations in the form of data archives (GithubArchive) and financial investment. Configurative numbers, by contrast, might be one term for a re-counting of capital numbers that pays more attention to the margins of indeterminacy that constitute  ensemble realities. Configurative re-counting points to imitative fluxes, to patterns of variation, to the organizational life of ensembles, and to the processes of concretisation that technical ensembles undergo as part of their genesis.

None of this discounts the capital numbers -- 29 million, 12 million -- as if they were merely false, reactive or performative numbers [@Espeland_2008]. The capital numbers are themselves a product of the ensemble, but view the ensemble from an external standpoint. But they offer little insight into the inter-commutativity that animates technical ensembles. In counting repositories in terms of names and the variations in those names, the configurative numbers presented in the preceding discussion cannot follow with any precision how different combinations of technical elements take shape and proliferate in the ensembles. The configurative numbers -- almost half of the repositories are copies; the vast majority of repositories only ever receive 1-2 events; a substantial proportion of code repositories have no code in them; oriented commutations of technical elements heavily contribute to the repository count; many repositories seem to archive work done elsewhere, as if Github were being used instrumentally -- discussed here are not exhaustive. They all derive from the simple measure of counting names in their copies and variations. The action of 'naming' lies at the heart of the massive systems of addressability associated with software  technical ensembles. 

To  de-activate essential link between working with digital data and ontological invention,  suggesting instead that any ontological epistemic transformation associated with significantly large numbers -- for instance, in claims about the epistemic potentials of data --  pivots on the crafting of new calculative agencies for fragile, weak and diffuse collectives.
