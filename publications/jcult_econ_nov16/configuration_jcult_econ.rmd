# Abstract

Technical ensembles such as social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems constitute an increasingly large yet relatively obscure zone of contemporary cultures. 
This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them.
Via a case study of a large technical ensemble -- the code repository Github.com -- that itself hosts the ongoing software development for many contemporary digital technical ensembles, it analyzes how such enumerations align themselves to the capitalization of the  technical ensemble.
As an alternative to this capitalization, the paper proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and the constant tuning, repairing and adjusting of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles comes into view.
An orientation and attunement to configuration, the paper suggests, provides an alternative critical affirmation of the inventive realities of technical ensembles, without simply re-iterating their capitalization. 

# Introduction

The reality of technical ensembles is difficult to engage with sociologically. At macro-scale, large  technical ensembles are highly prominent forms of organisation of economic and cultural life. We need only think of Facebook with 1.6 billion users as an example of a technical ensemble.  Its  effects on work, sociality, political  or cultural practices are widely discussed and debated.  At the micro-scale of individual experiences, such platforms largely disappear as ensembles, even as their interfaces and their terminals absorb large parts of people's lives in on-screen attention. Technical ensembles largely comprise an obscure central zone of practices, objects, processes and systems. Concepts of infrastructure, device, media and assemblage struggle for analytic purchase on this central zone of technical ensembles, a zone where combinations of sub-ensembles, machines, platforms, tools, processes of invention, practices of work, technical, geographical, social and energetic materialities entwine in manifold ways.  Importantly, large technical ensembles have temporalities of concretisation and abstraction, of oriented mutations and adaptation, that cannot be easily conceptualised in terms of tools, machine or infrastructures. They have a collective and social order that is not hierarchically organised, nor purely lateral flow. Today, their associative, imitative and often highly layered fabric owes much to the forms of software development or coding  woven through them. 

The difficulty of engaging with technical ensembles stems, if Gilbert Simondon is right, from the way in which the reality of technical objects has increasingly crystallised in collections of technical elements such as tools and machines [@Simondon_1989, 81]. In these collections, the reality of the ensemble can be expressed neither in the figure of the proprietor, the executive or chief operator (which in the case of Facebook would be  Mark Zuckerberg), nor in the figure of the myriad workers and users attached to the ensemble (who in the case of Facebook could well be any reader, whether they use Facebook or not [@Marshall_2016]). Neither property nor labour  access the configured and concrete operational reality of the technical ensemble, according to Simondon, because they both tend to treat the ensemble as an individual technical object, not as an ensemble or  as a mutable configuration, and mold perceptions of the technical ensemble according to either the utility or exchange value. 

# A technical meta-ensemble

Assuming that technical ensembles do have a configured operational reality, how would we engage with it sociologically? This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a single large number, currently standing at 48 million, associated with the collective existence of contemporary technical ensembles. The number '48 million' concerns the number of code repositories on the social media platform Github. The number stands in or represents what happens on  Github: coding or software development. 'Github is how people build software' according to Github  [@Github_2015]. While it is itself a technical ensemble, for present purposes, Github itself is not the primary focus. Given the millions of coding projects and millions of developers assembling it, Github  is a place where the obscure central zone or reality of technical ensembles might be more productively analyzed.

Github  instances key shifts in the way that technical ensembles aggregate, concretise and change over time. These shifts are heavily linked to coding practices.  Coding practices have changed over the last decade or so in several profound ways. The organization of software development has shifted away from individual machine-centred software development (the kind epitomised by Microsoft Windows or IBM mainframe software during the latter part of last century [@Campbell-Kelly_2003; @Ensmenger_2010]) to a much more de-centralized architectures of varying scope threaded across into communication and network infrastructures. Second, added to this global geography of coding, an explosion of digital devices and infrastructures, ranging from proliferating mobile devices and sensors to mushrooming data centres,  have widened the reach and variety of coding. Code circulates and addresses many more elements of the equipmental totality [@Heidegger_TBA]  - cameras, doors, cars, books -  than it did at the turn of the 21st century. Third, the lines and borders separating the production, distribution, and operation of code in technical ensembles have thoroughly blurred. Code flows in much more diverse ways through infrastructures and devices. For instance, 'devops' (development-operations) deploys frequently revised code directly into the ongoing transformative-maintenance of information infrastructure through continuous deployments, often directly from code repositories on sites such as Github [@Mackenzie_2016b].  Fourth, although the geography of coding work still centres on well-established urban centres such as San Francisco and London [@Mackenzie_2016], but by virtue of a much wider distribution of coding tools and skills, occurs in many other places as well. Finally, across all of these changes, coding has become a much more *public* economic and cultural activity (see [@Kelty_2008]), and the *publicness of code* has become a major concern for business, art,  government and science, albeit for different reasons (for instance, in scientific work, open data has been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of techniques, resources and tools for publishing code written for scientific purposes; for instance, in the many attempts to train school students and others to code as a putative 'basic life skill'). These five tendencies in coding work, all of which traverse and structure Github itself, perhaps merit much closer attention. But I offer them here as a way of signalling some of the complexities involved in making sense of contemporary technical realities. Github, we might say, is a technical meta-ensemble because it intensifies all of these tendencies in coding and software development. 

# Capital and configurative numbers

The social media site Github, started in in 2007, epitomises and has indeed been central -- as the suffix 'hub' suggests -- to the changes in developing code and hence in the relational fabric of many technical ensembles. Like other social media platforms, it has grown tremendously in the last 7 years. This growth flows from a tremendous variety of processes that are difficult to summarise or classify partly because the actors, topics or domains of coding are so diverse and partly because much of what flows through Github is both technically and socially 'innovative' in the sense that Bruno Latour uses the term: '" innovative" means that we do not know the number of actors involved in advance' [@Latour_1996, 72]. Github's growth is not unique. Online code repositories have existed for several decades (most famously [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net)), although more recent arrivals such Github, [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), GoogleCode (which has closed and migrated to Github), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or Gitorious tend to invite and promote collaborative coding on a larger scale.

Like many contemporary assemblages, Github has difficulty in describing its own genesis. It presents itself through large numbers such as `48 million`, and these numbers in their sometimes daily changes and updates attest to an investment in open-ended enumerations. These numbers are often accompanied by images that localise the social identity and geographic location of developers. In June 2014, the Github homepage showed a photo of a woman working in an urban office-loft (presumably San Francisco, where Github  is based), with lights and professional camera focused on her work. It described '6.1 million people collaborating right now across 13.2 million repositories ... building amazing things together' [@Github_2014a]. In late November 2015, Github has a slightly more functional description, and the image seems to be of Github founders in a press conference in China:

>GitHub is how people build software. With a community of more than 12 million people, developers can discover, use, and contribute to over 29 million projects using a powerful collaborative development workflow. [@Github_2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20151216055610/https://github.com/about)

The numbers change over time alongside the composition of the actors involved (women coding and working at Github, a sore point for the company; Chinese developers using Github, but also political activists, leading to a denial of service attack on the Github, allegedly by the Chinese government [^3]). But the changing numbers, alongside the sometimes rather sublime scales of 'community' (a 'community' of 18 million people?) in several respects only highlight and even exacerbate the difficulty of engaging with Github as a typical contemporary technical ensemble. 

[^3]: Neither image -- the woman at work in a loft-conversion office or the press conference in China -- is arbitrary, again suggesting that enumeration is always also configurative in the sense of materialising imaginaries of wholeness, difference, inclusion, etc.  Github was rocked in 2012 by allegations of sexism and mismanagement, particularly associated with one of the co-founders, who subsequently resigned and left Github [@Github_2014]. In early 2015, Github itself was subject to a massive Denial of Service attack, emanating from China. Reports alleged that the DoS attack targeted pro-democracy repositories on Github. Unlike its regulation of other social media platforms, China does not block Chinese citizens' use of Github because Github is seen as economically and commercially important for the software industry [@Marczak_2015].

Numbers such as 18 million 'people' and 48 million 'projects' do display something of the mode of existence of technical ensembles. In important ways they are part and parcel of platform politics and financial technological economies [@Gillespie_2010]. Given the capital investments that Github has attracted in the last few years (\$US100 million from the venture capital investment fund Andressen-Horowitz in 2012), these numbers affect flows of capital.  They may be somewhat 'false numbers' as Martha Lampland suggests, designed to enable certain forms of rationalization [@Lampland_2010]. They have the feel of what Carolin Gerlitz and Celia Lury describe in their study of the social reputation website Klout as 'reactive numbers' meant to evoke further work, action and engagement [@Gerlitz_2014a]. They may support claims of global importance (such as Facebook's 1.6 billion users). And they change: the series of numbers 29, 31, and now 48 million announce and perhaps enact Github as an 'enumerated entity' [@Verran_2012, 61] in time.

While Github features capital numbers on its webpages, those numbers re-play in other settings (for instance, in the many articles appearing in newspapers, magazines and business press about the popularity and growth of Github; see [@Hardy_2012;@Meyer_2013; @Gage_2015]).  Capital numbers resemble others in their cardinality (the number of elements ): population statistics for small nations, amounts of money spent on a new building, a research programme or a CEO's remuneration. They become visible and circulate in ways that prevent them from being easily assimilated to biopolitical or financial numbers. Their salience and pluri-potency will be described further below, but already they warrant some kind of designation and differentiation. We might call them 'capital numbers.' Capital here has the triple sense of a centre ('hub'), the capital letter of a proper noun (the 'G' in Github), and an accumulated fund with potential to growth. A capital number enumerates an aggregate, localizing and associating with a proper name, and promises the potential to generate further accumulation.

## The litany of sense-making: enumerating the aggregate through events

Take the number 48 million.  At the end of 2016,  the two main enumerations of Github  are 18 million 'people' and 48 million repositories. The people are software developers or coders (although, as ever with online platforms, a 'person' may be automated software or a bot [@TBA]. The Github projects counted here are `git` repositories,  collections of files mainly containing code, but also a great variety of operational documents (settings, manuals, installation instructions, etc.) stored in many versions and varieties. Any enumeration of Github contends with not only the sheer number of people visiting and using the platform, but the sheer diversity of ways in which they associate with each other through repositories using one or more of several hundred different programming or scripting languages. It is difficult to say which capital number matters more -- the head count or the repository count. On  Github, both normally appear in tandem: '2,641,337 people hosting over 4,442,708 repositories' announces the Github home page on 27 November 2012 [@Github_2012].

How does the number 48 million take shape? Github relies on elements of its own  technical ensemble to count the various actions of developers. The count of repositories is, however, an artefact of the way that the flow of code into and out of Github  is structured. In order to allow many versions to exist, and many people to work on the same code without introducing conflicting or incompatible changes, every repository or project on Github keeps snapshots of the state of the project. Versions of the same project may exist in parallel and/or in time. Control of the merging and branching of versions in projects lies at the centre of contemporary technical ensembles as they are updated, reconfigured, integrated, expanded, deployed and localised.  A remarkable proliferation of workflows appear on Github, and these workflows, sometimes comprising hundreds of thousands of distinct actions carried out on group projects, attest to the highly relational and commutative reality of technical ensembles. 

The relational intricacy arising from this control over versions affects almost every action or event on Github, even those that appear to be quite elementary. Take the act of copying a repository, which is called 'forking' by Github or 'cloning' by developers.  Such acts are published by Github on its API or Application Programmer Interface and this act of publishing itself attests to the fact that technical ensembles such as Github are themselves part of other ensembles that connect different platforms, devices, sites and practices together [@Bucher_2013]. An extract from a single recent ForkEvent is shown below.

```
{
    "actor": {
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7136540?",
        "gravatar_id": "",
        "id": "7136540",
        "login": "stas-g",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stas-g"
    },
    "created_at": "2016-12-07 00:09:21 UTC",
    "id": "4979965325",
    "org": null,
    "other": "{\"actor\":{\"display_login\":\"stas-g\"}}",
    "payload": " ...,
    "public": "true",
    "repo": {
        "id": "22321806",
        "name": "ntd/tccv",
        "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ntd/tccv"
    },
    "type": "ForkEvent"
}
```


The relatively simple  `ForkEvent` on Github shown in the data extract above documents the act of an `actor` calling themselves `stas-g` copying or forking   the repository called `tccv`, a software project coordinated by the 'actor' calling themself `ntd`.[^2]  The data has various status designations -- it is a `public` event, it has a 'payload' (not included in the extract) -- and contains various indexical references or `id`s (`repo_id`, `actor_id`, `gravatar_id`) that both link the event to other groups of people, organisations, repositories and images (`gravatar_id`). The intricate  syntax of this data (many brackets, inverted commas, colons, commas) attests to specific technical elements in the Github ensemble -- database  architectures in particular -- that allow coordination and alignment between  actors, actions, and code in time. More generally, the formatting of all actions  as events attests to the potential for the precise configuration of actors around a given repository to change or mutate in some way. New actors might be added; relations might appear between repositories; the location of entities might shift, and forms of association ('organizations') might subsume or grow out or around all of this. Formatting such changes as events accommodates them all within Github itself as technical ensemble.


[^2]: In what follows, I use monospace font like `this` when referring to entities named in the Github data. The typography highlights entities to enumeration by capital numbers.

## Depth in the flux of events

For our purposes, the formatting of action and change in events  provides momentary apprehensions of the ongoing genesis of technical ensembles more generally. Rather than the lump sum of 48 million repositories, this data -- and there is much of it readily available since data flow is deeply important to  technical ensembles such as Github [^4]  -- provides a quite fine-grained series of numbers relating to different actors and things. The granularity comes at a cost. Instead of 48 million, we now have a much more detailed but configured series of numbers.

[^4]: An archive purporting to contain all of the Github data appeared in mid-2012. Ilya Grigorik, a 'Web Performance Engineer' at Google, launched a Github repository `igrigorik/githubarchive` linked to a website `GithubArchive.org` dedicated to amalgamating all the Github API public event data -- the so-called 'timeline' --  in one place [@Grigorik_2012].  Grigorik, or `igrigorik`not only published all the data in a cloud-based data store but transformed that data, whose formatting we have glimpsed above, into the flat tabular forms familiar in much statistical work, [@Campbell-Kelly_2003a] and made it available through Google's newly launched cloud computing service, GoogleBigQuery.


```{r event_table,  echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
library(xtable)
library(knitr)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
df = read.csv('data/event_counts.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
kable(df[df$events>0, c(1,2)], row.names=FALSE, caption='Table: (\tab:event-counts) Github event counts 2012-2015')

```

Table @\ref(tab:event-counts) shows something of the problem.[^13] Github itself  publicly presents all the events on the platform. From that, we might begin to grasp the kinds of change, aggregations, and commutations occurring as technical ensemble ensembles take shape, concretise, localize or indeed break down. But with around one million events each day (in December 2016), making sense of these processes might seem difficult. The 300 million or so events summarised in Table @\ref(tab:event-counts) suggest a variety of different practices ('push', 'create,' 'watch,' 'pullrequest',  'fork'), yet we can gain little sense of the distribution of the associated actions, what they refer to, or indeed to whom or what they might matter from such data. From the event counts, it seems, we gain nothing better than a slight feeling of awe in front of a post-industrial technical sublime. If we are interested in the obscure central zone of technical ensembles, how does this help?

[^13]: The table results from the simple query `select type, count(type) as events from [githubarchive:github.timeline] group by type order by events descending`  run on GoogleBigQuery. Like the data on GithubArchive, the GoogleBigQuery copy of the Github public timeline data was updated hourly. 
In late 2015, the main GithubArchive timeline dataset on GoogleBigQuery was frozen. Data after that date flows into new datasets named by the month. e.g. [https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/githubarchive:month.201107) points to the data for July 2011. This partitioning of the data on a 'big data' platform such as GoogleBigQuery attests to the voluminous flows of events through Github. For the purposes of my argument, and to simplify code slightly, I only make use of the main Github timeline dataset covering 2012-2015.

Github, like many contemporary  technical ensembles, tracks and measures everything that happens on its platform. Metrics for its own operation are part of the ongoing re-invention of the ensemble. (See for instance, the [Github Engineering blog](http://githubengineering.com/) for many examples of this metric aspect of the ensemble). Knowing what is happening at various points in the distributed operation of Github is a key concern, just as it is in financial markets [@Knorr-Cetina_2002] or in control rooms more generally.  While certain technical metrics -- response times of servers in the data centres, number of read/write operations/minute, etc. -- are constantly monitored and sometimes acted upon by engineers, the variety, heterogeneity, significance and possible economic value of what takes place in the ensemble is much harder to gauge, both for Github and perhaps for any sociological analysis of technical ensembles. 

During 2012-2014 Github organised 'data challenges' [@Github_2013] based on the GithubArchive event data. It invited entrants to these challenges to use the data to make sense of what was happening on Github. We could these data challenges from the perspective of capital numbers:  they occasion practical re-countings of the data that elaborate the capital numbers with greater mobility, value and media or inscriptive form. Given the technical hurdles of working with large amounts of Github data, most entrants to the competitions were themselves developers or data scientists. 

\begin{figure}

      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/osrc.png}
        \caption{The Open Source Report Card }
  \label{fig:osrc}
\end{figure}

For instance,  the 'OpenSource Report Card' (http://osrc.dfm.io/)  or `dfm/osrc` by Dan Foreman-Mackay [@Foreman-Mackay_2014], is a prize-winning use of the timeline data (see Figure \ref{fig:osrc}). It ingests all the data from the Githubarchive, counting what developers do, when they do it, and with what programming languages. With this data stored, it then builds a predictive model that allows it to both profile a given Github user, and to predict similarities between developers. Here the mass of events in the Github timeline are brought to bear on finding similarities between people. An admonition from Foreman-Mackay  – 'Dear recruiters: While you read this, make sure that you remember that GitHub is not your C.V. and that these stats only provide a biased and one-sided view. This is just a toy. Don't take it too seriously! ' – suggests that even playful application of the data attest to the proximity of capitalisation and labour value in what happens on Github. For coders, programmers and software developers, the profile of their activity on Github repositories can be part of getting work.

In response to the Github Data Challenge in 2012, people looked for feelings or 'sentiments' in the data.  Feelings associated with coding were mined by counting emotional words present in comments accompanying the Github events (http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/). The presence of words in these message can be cross-linked with programming languages in order to profile how different programming languages elicit different emotional reactions. This emphasises how software developers or coders feel in relation to different kinds of coding. Certain languages attract exasperation and others pleasure (see [@Coleman_2012] for a broader account of these feelings). The enumeration of affects animates the capital numbers with an underpinning affectivity associated with coding in both its vicissitudes and its unevenly shared dividends of participation in and control of technical ensembles [@Chun_2011].  

The capital numbers associated with Github also begin to acquire a geography through the GithubArchive data. Many entrants mapped coders and repositories by geographic location. The  mapping of Github contributions by location performed by David Fischer (http://davidfischer.github.io/gdc2/#languages/All) is typical in that it too counts events, but this time puts the emphasis on the geography of the 'top' repositories, coders and their programming languages [@Fischer_2013a]. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/octoboard.png}
        \caption{Octoboard: Github activity dashboard }
  \label{fig:octoboard}
\end{figure}

Echoing the metrics and gauges that Github constructs to monitor and regulate its own operations, other entrants to the data challenges made live dashboards for Github. `Octoboard` (http://octoboard.com/) animates changes on Github using the timeline data [@Roussell_2015] (see Figure \ref{fig:octoboard}). `Octoboard` ornaments the capital numbers with a range of peripheral live enumerations that point to the liveliness of events on Github. It presents a summary of daily activity in major categories on Github – how many new repositories, how many issues, how repositories have been 'open sourced' today. It offers almost real-time analytics on emotions. Like many other dashboards associated with social media analytics, `octoboard` suggests that the constant change in associations and projects in software development can no longer be known through leisurely rhythms of analysis, but is increasingly framed as  a problem  realtime awareness. Significant shifts, trends, hotspots of activity, improbably important marginal developments or breakdowns need to be brought into immediate view through  'stream analytics.' That is, not also does the data stream, but the analysis is meant to stream as well in order to be timely, lively and responsive to change.


The data challenges attract many different treatments of the Github timeline data. They depend on the publication of the data flow of events as a  'big data' dataset on GoogleBigQuery. The dataset is taken up in various quarters, [^14] and its public availability  augments or supports the capital numbers that Github enumerates. The visualizations, maps, models and  dashboards of labour, geography, affect, and logistics  enliven, animate, reactivate, localise and qualify  capital numbers such as 48 million.  They potentialise the numbers in terms of expansiveness, liveness  and further accumulation by summing them up in different ways (realtime, networks of connections, geographies of work and affect), and by beginning to analyse forms of association or relation (social network analysis, machine learning classification and prediction).  

[^14]: Looking slightly more widely,  the Github timeline data has quickly become a favourite training tool for data mining textbooks books that configure and convey the calculative agencies characteristic of capital numbers. In  *Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More,* Matthew Russell makes use of the Github timeline to demonstrate ways of uses social network analysis to highlight the important nodes and links between repositories and users [@Russell_2013]. Again, the propensity to apply network analysis approaches is widespread and endemic to the data itself, given the way that the event format is already implicitly framed by a network or 'social media' understanding. For academic researchers in computer science and certain parts of organisation studies, Github has been a boon because they study technologically and economically important practices software development in the wild much more easily.  Academic researchers in fields such as software engineering do social network analysis in order to gauge productivity, reuse, efficiency and other engineering and management concern [@Thung_2013]. Like the many Github-hosted projects discussed above, they analyse sentiment [@Guzman_2014], collaboration and productivity [@Dabbish_2012], and geography [@Takhteyev_2010].
