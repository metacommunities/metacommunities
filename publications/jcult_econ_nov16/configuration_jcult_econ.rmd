# Abstract - 2nd version


Technical ensembles such as social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems constitute an increasingly large yet relative obscure zone of contemporary cultures. 
This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them.
Via a case study of a large technical ensemble -- the code repository Github.com -- that itself hosts the ongoing software development for many contemporary digital technical ensembles, it analyzes how such enumerations align themselves to the capitalization of the  technical ensemble.
As an alternative to this capitalization, the paper proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and synchronisation, and the constant discarding and repairing of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles comes into view.
An orientation and attunement to configuration, the paper suggests, provides an alternative critical affirmation of the realities of technical ensembles, without simply re-iterating their capitalization.
