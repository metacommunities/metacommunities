# Abstract

Large or 'capital' numbers abound in social media platform marketing and are an integral part of their accumulation strategies. 
Debates have recently centred on the inherent instability of enumeration in practice, the reactivity of numbers in media assemblages, the being of number, the productive falseness of numbers  or the configuration of market calculations.
This paper reports on attempts to re-count or re-figure a single capital number,  the approximately 29 million code repositories on the social media coding platform Github.
Github is a website used by software developers to store and work on code using social network-style practices.    
In the case of Github it is possible to analyse  the sense-making processes that practically configure measurements, calculations, diagrams, figures and statements relating to 'capital numbers.' 
By exploring how capital numbers emerge from platform-specific practices of joining, association, and accumulation, we can begin to see how different renderings of number fragment the collective processes.  
The paper suggests that capital numbers might be understood and used as configurative devices.
Such devices both delineate the composition of complex cultural-technical aggregates and materialise imagined wholes amidst great diversity and multiplicity. 
It re-counts configurative numbers by paying attention to the acts of visualization, imitation, and duplication characteristic of digital practices, and the complex, device-specific   configurations that give rise to them. 

# Abstract - 2nd version

Technical ensembles such as social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems constitute an increasingly large yet relative obscure zone of contemporary cultures. 
This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them.
Via a case study of a large technical ensemble -- the code repository Github.com -- that itself hosts the ongoing software development for many contemporary digital technical ensembles, it analyzes how such enumerations align themselves to the capitalization of the  technical ensemble.
As an alternative to this capitalization, the paper proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles.
In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and synchronisation, and the constant discarding and repairing of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles comes into view.
An orientation and attunement to configuration, the paper suggests, provides an alternative critical affirmation of the realities of technical ensembles, without simply re-iterating their capitalization. 

# Abstract 3rd version

Technical ensembles  -- social network sites, online content management systems, streaming media platforms, mobile communication systems, scientific models, supply chain logistics management solutions, or cryptocurrency systems --  stand at the centre  of contemporary cultural processes. This paper examines attempts to enumerate the elements of such technical ensembles by counting, mapping or listing them in the form of large numbers. Via a case study of  the code repository platform [Github.com](https://github.com), it analyzes how such enumerations participate in the capitalization of technical ensembles. As an alternative to the capitalization of ensembles, the paper also proposes a configurative enumeration of elements of technical ensembles. In a configurative enumeration, the diverse composition, the rhythms of imitation, variation and commutation, and the constant relating, tuning, repairing and adjusting of technical elements crucial to the ongoing existence of technical ensembles come into view. Configurative enumerations, the paper suggests, might critically articulate some of the inventive realities of technical ensembles, realities which condition and sometimes diverge from their capitalization.
