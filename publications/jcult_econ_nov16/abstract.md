# Abstract

Large or 'capital' numbers abound in social media platform marketing and are an integral part of their accumulation strategies. 
Debates have recently centred on the inherent instability of enumeration in practice, the reactivity of numbers in media assemblages, the being of number, the productive falseness of numbers  or the configuration of market calculations.
This paper reports on attempts to re-count or re-figure a single capital number,  the approximately 29 million code repositories on the social media coding platform Github.
Github is a website used by software developers to store and work on code using social network-style practices.    
In the case of Github it is possible to analyse  the sense-making processes that practically configure measurements, calculations, diagrams, figures and statements relating to 'capital numbers.' 
By exploring how capital numbers emerge from platform-specific practices of joining, association, and accumulation, we can begin to see how different renderings of number fragment the collective processes.  
The paper suggests that capital numbers might be understood and used as configurative devices.
Such devices both delineate the composition of complex cultural-technical aggregates and materialise imagined wholes amidst great diversity and multiplicity. 
It re-counts configurative numbers by paying attention to the acts of visualization, imitation, and duplication characteristic of digital practices, and the complex, device-specific   configurations that give rise to them.
