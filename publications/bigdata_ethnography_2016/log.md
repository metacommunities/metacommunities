##TODO

- look at who cites Kelty 2005 and Coleman 2009, etc. 
- add global assemblage into general references for gh -- gh as platform, but one that cannot fully capture the flows that run across it ...

- starting to look at literature on ethnography and code
    This article investigates the social, technical, and legal affiliations among  'geeks' (hackers, lawyers, activists, and IT entrepreneurs) on the Internet. The mode of association specific to this group is that of 'recursive public sphere'' constituted by a shared imaginary of the technical and legal conditions of possibility for their own association. On the basis of fieldwork conducted in the United States, Europe, and India, I argue that geeks imagine their social existence and relations as much through technical practices (hacking, networking, and code writing) as through discursive argument (rights, identities, and relations). In addition, they consider a 'right to tinker' a form of free speech that takes the form of creating, implementing, modifying, or using specific kinds of software (especially Free Software) rather than verbal discourse.

    that's Kelty's abstract
- re-writing abstract to include some of the code literature. Got it down to 11 sentences, and removed much of the imitation argument (keep for large numbers paper).

- re-did abstract for a third time -- came up with a better title -- intersectional assemblages and analytic affiliations, etc. Should be more doable. And I don't need to worry about the big data work too much
- sending abstract off.

- started writing the chapter, mainly drawing on EASST paper approach -- big number as the site of encounter



## Wed  7 Sep 09:27:42 BST 2016
- not sure how to include in next part of paper -- for instance, the query ...  



## Thu Sep  8 16:52:30 BST 2016

- moved numbers barcelona doc across from other branch so that I can start this main document again. 
- got very distracted in tensorflow configuration work -- typical of  big data stuff


## Fri Sep  9 09:15:28 BST 2016

- is TensorFlow (now working with GPU on Docker image) such a distraction? Seems to me that Docker is probably the real interest at the moment since it seems to change configuration work 


## Tue Sep 13 11:38:36 BST 2016

- been putting many more of the queries into the text -- that's the real focus now -- working with these queries. Could put all the queries into Gists, and just link them all. Or could make the whole paper into a DockerContainer. ...  
- managed to write the rest of the events section, adding new queries to bolster it out. 





## Wed 14 Sep 17:20:04 BST 2016
-struggled quite a lot of with associative imitation graphs -- working on converting those from ipython,etc to ggplot format. But not sure if it is worth the effort. 
- does give some ideas of working with names as I try to do it ... 


## Thu Sep 15 13:19:06 BST 2016

- all morning working on 'streamgraphs' for forks -- this has been a huge effort, but now have functions that plot them for any repo. 
- seems to be some shift in the data at end of 2014 -- everything shifts in the counts. 
- put in the two stacked plots for android and bootstrap. Need to write a bit more commentary on what is going on here. 
- and perhaps think whether counting FOrks is the right thing to do ...

 great morning working on chapter -- going back through early parts and fixing them up by adding in literature, some bits of code and a general focusing of the arguments.
- still have not put in the configuration material, but am around 5000 words at the moment.
- also realized something very obvious but important -- I can't count all the repos because I don't know how many are private. But I can see event id numbers - I saw them using the 'events' api. IF event ideas on the public api are consecutive for all events, then I can estimate home many private repos there are, and how private repos have grown by imputing them from events. See fuller discussion of this in ideas log. 
- almost ready to bring in the configuration -- the question for me is how to make it more reflexive ...
