- starting to look at literature on ethnography and code
    This article investigates the social, technical, and legal affiliations among  'geeks' (hackers, lawyers, activists, and IT entrepreneurs) on the Internet. The mode of association specific to this group is that of 'recursive public sphere'' constituted by a shared imaginary of the technical and legal conditions of possibility for their own association. On the basis of fieldwork conducted in the United States, Europe, and India, I argue that geeks imagine their social existence and relations as much through technical practices (hacking, networking, and code writing) as through discursive argument (rights, identities, and relations). In addition, they consider a 'right to tinker' a form of free speech that takes the form of creating, implementing, modifying, or using specific kinds of software (especially Free Software) rather than verbal discourse.

    that's Kelty's abstract
- re-writing abstract to include some of the code literature. Got it down to 11 sentences, and removed much of the imitation argument (keep for large numbers paper).

- re-did abstract for a third time -- came up with a better title -- intersectional assemblages and analytic affiliations, etc. Should be more doable. And I don't need to worry about the big data work too much
- sending abstract off.

- started writing the chapter, mainly drawing on EASST paper approach -- big number as the site of encounter

##TODO

- look at who cites Kelty 2005 and Coleman 2009, etc. 
- add global assemblage into general references for gh -- gh as platform, but one that cannot fully capture the flows that run across it ...
