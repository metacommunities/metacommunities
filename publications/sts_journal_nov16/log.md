- looked at submission guidelines http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjce20&page=instructions#mp_style
- might need to shorten a bit to get under 8000 words -- seems ok
- moved files from sss to here -- abstract.md, figures, ref_bibs, and number_jcult_econ.rmd
- also looked through marcus article on ethnography as prototyping and put it in zotero data_forms as well as ~/archive/marcus_Prototyping and Contemporary Anthropological Experiments With Ethnographic Method_2012.pdf

- need a todo list for this paper -- that might mean    
    - TODO:printing it
    - TODO:cutting it down to size
    - TODO:updating some of the methods talk
    - TODO:bringing in some of the new queries and diagrams I've done
    - TODO:adding a few notes on the massive ddos
- ok, formatting for printing -- not so easy! and printed it
- TODO: work out a good title
- TODO: check out recent jcultecon papers -- the virtual si on digital is good starting point http://explore.tandfonline.com/page/ah/journal-of-cultural-economy-digital-world; should refer to articles by Marres & Fish, and possibly some of the stuff on markets; e.g. Callon or Deville on attachments? 
- Did a search on number, which led to quite a lot of results, but nothing related particularly to the re-counting work I'm proposing. How can I narrow this down? If this was a contribution to STS, then how would keep the method stuff. But JCE, it seems like the attachment, affective, re-counting, etc ideas would be better. In that case, however, where does the counting work I suggest fit? Is counting a method we should adopt more?     
- initial thoughts are that I should reorder the paper a bit in this order:
    1. prominence of the number, including multiple ddos, venture capital, media
    2. notion of configuration as a way of making sense of this 
- But I could also just read the reports, revise and submit to STS
