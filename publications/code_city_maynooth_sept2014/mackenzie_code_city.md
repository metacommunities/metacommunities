> The initial step can be made through the venerable geographical act of mapping the expanding realm of machinekind, clearly part of the remaining terra incognita. [@Horvath_1974, 188]

Writing in 2002, Nigel Thrift and Shaun French asked: 'is there any way of making a more general assessment of software in the city?' [@Thrift_2002,  314].  They sketch some possibilities, ranging from hegemony to haunting:

> It would be easy at this point to fall back on some familiar notions to describe software's grip on spaces like cities. One would be hegemony. But that notion suggests a purposeful project, whilst software consists of numerous projects cycling through and continually being rewritten in code. Another notion would be haunting. But again the notion is not quite the right one. Ghosts are ethereal presences, phantoms that are only half- there, which usually obtain their effects by stirring up emotions – of fear, angst, regret, and the like [@Thrift_2002, 311-312].

Thrift and French's empirical response to their own question begins with the Y2K bug, and the long lists of software potentially affected by it: keypad locks, pagers, solar panels, smoke detectors, camcorders, VCRs, elevators. Although these lists now look dated, when a similar listing would include so many  things that didn't exist in 2002, Thrift and French's description of the effect of software development on urban space remains recognisable: 'we will exist in a broadband world in which the internet will be a permanently available ‘cloud’ of information able to be called up through a number of appliances scattered through the environment. These appliances will be something more than portals for information. Rather, like many other devices which will not have internet connections, they will be "practice-aware"' (315) and 'will, through a process of cultural absorption into practices, sink down from the representational into the non- representational world, so becoming a part of a taken-for-granted set of passions and skills' (318). The fact that these developments more than a decade later are still very much in train suggests that there is something quite predictable about the development of software and coding in organising urban life and spaces.  

They go to  list three geographies that were driving code into cities: a geography of *writing code*, a geography of *power and control*, and a geography of *indeterminancy.*  

>  The first of these geographies is the most obvious, the large and complex geography of the writing of software – of the production of lines of code – a geography that takes in many different locations and many different languages and which has been built up progressively since the invention of programming in the 1940s [@Thrift_2002, 323].

According to Thrift and French, the geography of software writing clusters around  key places and regions: Silicon Valley, New York, London, and a number of auxiliary software mass production zones (often concentrating on tasks like consulting, testing and support) in countries like Ireland and India. China, Russia and Brazil are not mentioned.  

A second less concentrated geography of power, conceived in Foucaultean terms as the conduct of conduct, or massive proliferation of corporeally practiced rules, was also  unfurling through software: 'in essence, we can say that it [software] consists of rules of conduct able to be applied to determinate situations' [@Thrift_2002, 325]. Through power-geography, software increasingly interlinks rather than compartmentalises urban processes. (Again,  the ongoing growth of data analytics, virtualizing computing infrastructures, social media, mobile apps and sensors is largely consistent with this analysis of power.)

A  final geography was the most open and the least geographically localised. In this geography, abundance produces indeterminacy and lack of closure:

> the general profusion of software, its increasing complexity and consequent emergent properties, all count as means of producing playful idioms that have not been captured by dominant orders. Software's very indeterminacy and lack of closure provide a means of creating new kinds of order (328). 

These playful idioms are largely irreducible to the centres of coding or power-generated control practices, and therefore will take on singular forms, unexpected locations and non-representational aspects. Where or how does the geography of indeterminacy take shape? Against various attempts to see software and code as either hegemonic, as law, as an epochal shift, as what has always haunted writing, or as the epitome of the post-human technics, Thrift and French sketched  the phenomenality of code  as a form of traffic: 

> Software is more like a kind of traffic between beings, wherein one sees, so to speak, the effects of the relationship. What transpires becomes reified in actions, body stances, general anticipations. We would argue, then, that software is best thought of as a kind of absorption, an expectation of what will turn up in the everyday world.[@Thrift_2002, 312]

These formulations are the most elliptical in the paper.  But the 'traffic between beings' they refer to here, the reification of 'general anticipations,' the curiously contrasting descriptions of software as absorption _and_ expectation could be seen as implicitly urban. They concern 'traffic' in everyday worlds. 

More than a decade later, these geographies remain in play. Code work is done in more or less the same places; and the coded conduct of conduct certainly continues. But when  we think about code in terms of traffic, what has happened to it? What kinds of new order have eventuated? Writing in 2014, Thrift again asks addressed coded cities: 'Take just the case of coded cities understood as a whole,' [@Thrift_2014, 13], and then proceeds to offer a sixfold topography of the code city - as externalization of capitalist power,  as prescribed matter of concern, as care-laden responses to the demand for resilience, as projected-retrojected dream life, as navigational geometry, and as materialized visualisation. He finally suggests that something links this diversity: the possibility for 'these entities to learn ... to transform themselves.'   Echoing the 2001 discussion of the geography of indeterminacy, he attributes this possibility to 'emergent tendencies arising out of complexity' or 'through simple happenstance which places them in unexpected situations which require adaptation' (13). 

The sixfold evocation of the coded-city proliferates the geographies of software in the city, but it reiterates the same kinds of transformative capacity earlier enunciated in the geography of indeterminacy.  The 2001 formulations on indeterminacy and 'traffic in beings' grow into forms of novel encounter in 'unexpected situations.' (While urban sociology has long understood cities in terms of encounters between strangers, Thrift's account shifts the emphasis to unexpected encounters between other beings.)  Coded cities' 'capacity to learn' transpires, according to this account, in elementary forms of movement understood as *code traffic.* The 'authoring,' the 'learning', and the transformations should not only be traceable in code, but coding itself is one place where externalizations, matters of concern, geometries,  projections, visualizations, resilience-care, etc. come together and affect each other.

Exploring the code traffic entails a theoretical move and a theory of movement. The theoretical move is understand the  'traffic between beings' as moving and mixing along various paths (such as those described by Thrift in 2014: projection, geometry, matters of concern, care-resilience, externalization, visualization, etc.) through processes of _imitation_.  I'm drawing on crowd sociology, including the work of Gabriele Tarde and Robert E. Park, as a theory of imitative movement.  For both Tarde the microsociologist of crowds and Park the urban sociologist,  imitation is a tremendously powerful shaping force that semi-consciously effects repetition and invention, and generates new social forms of various kinds [@borch2012politics, 58, 144]. In particular, Tarde speaks of  'coadaptation of imitative fluxes, a cooperation, even in an individual brain, but always a multitude of agents social and infinitesimal, and their ordinary ideas' [@Tarde_1902, 270]. While there is much to discuss here (for instance, Tarde's political conservatism and anachronism poses analytical problems), the 'coadaptation' of imitations in combination with a  multitude of infinitesimal agents, beneath and around individuals, suggests  some ways of tracking tendencies  in code.  Examining patterns of imitation in code moves the emphasis away from code-shaping-cities to code-as-crowd. In the code-crowd, imitation is not just follow-the-leader, although this is quite prevalent, but also mutual shaping of imitative fluxes running between people and machines in places.[^1]

[^1]: This, I should note, is a departure from most crowd theory, crowd psychology and crowd sociology. In most cases, objects hardly figure at all. As I will sketch below, points of identification occurs between systems, platforms, protocols and patterns just as much as  between individuals. 

To treat *code-as-crowd* is not to deny the production and power geographies of code. It is not to say that code does not still act on cities, on space, on public and private practices.  High profile and much discussed changes taking place in computational platforms (mobile devices, cloud, etc) and in algorithmic processes (machine learning) intricately reorganise urban life. What transpires there is rapidly reified in actions, body stances, etc.   But it might also be worth seeing how cities, with their massive centralising tendencies, with their sometime globe-spanning relationalities, with their density of infrastructures, with their high rates of reconstruction and repair, and above all with their affective-practical-epidemiological contagions _crowd_ into  contemporary software. We would, from this standpoint, no longer concentrate on following how software, code and algorithms emanate from global centres  as hypervisory control structures  reorganizing cities.  Furthermore, we would no longer focus on isolated pieces of code, systems or applications but on the transverse flows that change how code itself moves and takes shape. We would apprehend coding itself as something closer to pedestrian and vehicle movements in a busy street. That is to say, we might attempt to see software and code as  noisy, crowded, propagating aggregates in which juxtapositions, proximities and patterns of imitation multiply through each other, or *convolve*. To see code-as-crowd might bring us a few steps closer to the traffic in beings that transforms itself. The practical paths that opens out from seeing code-as-crowd concerns what we should look  in studying software and code. If code is a kind of traffic between beings, if is not only a community but a *metacommunity,* not only an ecology but a crowd, then we need to find places where shape-shifting crowds assemble in code.[^2]
