This paper reports on an  attempt to re-count a large number, in this case, the approximately 20 million code repositories on the social media platform Github.
Science studies and related fields have a decades-long interest in numbers and counting, both in understanding the power-politics of numbering and the diversity of numbering practices.
Debates have recently centred on the accountability of numberings and stand against a background of sociological debates about challenges to empirical methods posed by increasingly abundant digital data.
Drawing on these accounts of number, the paper will suggest that science studies might develop ways of re-counting large numbers as capital numbers.
A capital number combines a sense of importance, the potential to be turned to profit and to name something. 
In the Github case, the genesis of capital numbers, such as '20 million' or '300 million,' can be re-counted in two different ways.
We can analyse the sense-making processes that practically invest in and supplement those numbers with measurements, diagrams and statements.
Such processes translate numbers into  regimes of social, aesthetic,political, technical and commercial value. 
We can also re-count some of the acts of imitation, copying, cloning and duplication that comprising mundane Github practice, and show how give rise to capital numbers.
The re-counting of capital numbers has several implication for counting more generally. 
It directly contests the value-laden measures associated with certain large numbers, showing that capital numbers hide many inflationary processes.
It decouples any essential link between working with digital data and ontological invention. 
It suggests instead that any ontological or epistemic transformation associated with large numbers -- for instance, in claims about the epistemic potentials of data --  pivots on fragile, weak and diffuse collectives.
