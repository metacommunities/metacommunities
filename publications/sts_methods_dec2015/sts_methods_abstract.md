What constitute good counting today?  t constitute good counting today?  I'll report on a deliberately naive attempt to count approximately 12 million code repositories on the social media platform Github. STS work has a long -standing interest in numbers and counting. In light of recent STS debates around number, the whole and parts, device/platform-specific research, and broader sociological debates about challenges to empirical methods posed by data mining, I'll suggest that acts of describing and counting things have become highly loaded and contestable. The forms of counting I explore will focus on problems of copying, duplicating, and imitation that render count data a moving substrate.
