Read Deepsy Github site from Impact story. They use GithubArchive, cran and pypi to analyse reuse of software, and software dependences in science. 

Good use of GoogleBigQuery, pagerank, etc. to do this. see [Draft Paper](https://github.com/Impactstory/depsy-research/blob/master/introducing_depsy.Rmd)
