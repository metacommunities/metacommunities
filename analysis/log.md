- could see Github  as UGC on speed -- hardly any consumption there, just making. Where would that sit with the other range of activities?
- is there any way just to check for things like timestamps, or particular operations of calculation (Callon style) or particular styles of platform usage (Cloud, virtualisation)?
- wrote query for GoogleBigQuery to test this:
    SELECT repository_name, type, created_at, payload_commit, payload_commit_msg FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] 
    where payload_commit_msg != "null" and regexp_match(payload_commit_msg, 'virtualiz') limit 10

    - added this to sql list
    - could also extend it to include repo name and org name
    - would need to craft search queries for different topics  -- 'docker or chef or etc.'
