# Null language repos

Null language repos may comprise 70% of the total repo count on Github. 
So much effort has gone to show how different languages are used, and how they have different communities. What about all of the repos that have no language? Do they matter?

```{r null_language, cache=TRUE}
knit_hooks$set(inline = function(x) {
  prettyNum(x, big.mark=",")
  })
library(bigrquery)
query =  "SELECT count(distinct(repository_url)) as repo_count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] WHERE repository_language IS NULL"
query3 =  "SELECT count(distinct(repository_url)) as repo_count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] WHERE repository_language IS NOT NULL"
query2 =  "SELECT count(distinct(repository_url)) as repo_count FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline]"
null_count = query_exec(query, 'metacommunities')
full_count = query_exec(query2, 'metacommunities')
lang_count = query_exec(query3, 'metacommunities')
null_count
full_count
lang_count
query4 =  "SELECT count(repository_url) as Events FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline] WHERE repository_language IS NULL"
null_event_lang_count = query_exec(query4, 'metacommunities')
null_event_lang_count
query5 =  "SELECT count(repository_url) as Events FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline]"
total_events = query_exec(query5, 'metacommunities')
total_events
null_proportion =round( null_event_lang_count/total_events*100)
null_proportion
```


That's pretty amazing -- `r null_count` repositories of the total `r full_count` repositories do not have a language recorded. `r lang_count` repositories do have a language recorded or detected. Put differently, of the `r total_events` in the timeline data, `r null_event_lang_count` come from repositories with no programming language. That is, around `r round(null_event_lang_count/total_events*100)`%. A significant amount of work is going into these repositories.  

What is going on here?
