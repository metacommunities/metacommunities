# Ideas for further data analysis

## Could we build a 'readme' classifier that gives us an idea of whether a given repo readme is actually:
	
1. a description of a software project (various levels here -- licences, etc)
2. mainly information about how to install/configure some software
3. some other kind of repo -- book, etc
4. junk/nothing

So we don't try to find the topic of the readme, only what kind of read me it is. 


## the duplication during 2012

download august-sept 2012 and check number of events against timeline;
good to use grigorich own repo to look at this
why can't we detect duplicate rows in bigquery and get rid of them?

## Original work on github as platform

Look at the time series of Github staff:

defunkt
drnic
halorgium
kballard
maddox
mojombo
schacon
