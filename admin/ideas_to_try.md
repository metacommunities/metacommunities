# Ideas for further data analysis

## Could we build a 'readme' classifier that gives us an idea of whether a given repo readme is actually:
	
1. a description of a software project (various levels here -- licences, etc)
2. mainly information about how to install/configure some software
3. some other kind of repo -- book, etc
4. junk/nothing

So we don't try to find the topic of the readme, only what kind of read me it is.
