metacommunities
===============


This repository documents a one year study of Github software repositories in aggregate. We aimed to study how repositories compose of field of devices interacting with each other through processes of imitation, incorporation, and citation. The idea of 'metacommunities' was to understand the relations between the many, many repositories on Github in terms a community ecology metaphor. 

This preliminary release of some of the publications, data analysis, scripts, secondary data and figures from the research does not comprise a polished product. It does however provide, via the archival features of Github and `git` itself a reasonably comprehensive record of the work done on the project up to the release date (11 November 2014). Later releases of the project will contain further publications, reports and data analyses. 


It is based in Sociology at Lancaster University (UK), led by Adrian Mackenzie. Co-investigators are Matthew Fuller (Goldsmiths, London) and Andrew Goffey (Nottingham). Richard Mills  and Stu Sharples are the postdoctoral researchers working on the project. 

The project was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council under its 2013 'Google and Data Analytics' funding scheme. 

## Navigating the Metacommunities Repository

The main components of the repository are:

1. [Publications](publications) - manuscripts in process of publication as well as papers and presentations written for conferences and workshops

2. [Data Analysis](data_analysis) -- scripts, sample and secondary data, and figures or plots produced in the course of the work. These range across a number of different foci including:

    - [social practices](data_analysis/github_social_practices/)
    - [trends and tendencies](data_analysis/github_time)
    - [platform specific features](data_analysis/github_platform/)
    - [software repository topics](data_analysis/github_repository_topics/)
    - [data analytic experiments](data_analysis/github_data_infrastructures/)
